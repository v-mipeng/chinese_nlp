Tibet rail line is a marvel, but China is mum
Chinese reticence has much to do with aspirations for Tibetan independence

GOLMUD, SEPTEMBER 12 : By the time the great railroad reaches this town from the east, it will already have traversed more than half of China, past the high desert of Qinghai, around one of the worlds great salt lakes, through the arid fastness of Gansu and over and around mountain ranges arrayed like endless sets of waves all the way to Beijing.

The biggest challenges, however, lie when the line heads to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, over what is often called the roof of the world. For long stretches the railway, which is fast nearing completion, will operate at altitudes higher than many small planes can fly. Indeed, the train, whose engines will need turbochargers just to get enough oxygen to run, will often soar above the clouds.

One might expect a country that is pulling off one of the worlds great engineering feats to be eager to show off its handiwork. If so, no one has told the Railway Ministry, which for a full year refused to answer requests to visit the new line.

What could explain such a reluctance to show off this marvel of railway building? As was underscored by events in Lhasawhere Beijing was celebrating the 40th anniversary of what it calls the Tibet Autonomous Regionit had much to do with Tibetan aspirations for independence.

By some estimates, the new train will carry as many as 900,000 people to Tibet each year, with the newcomers overwhelmingly consisting of members of Chinas Han majority, many of whom will opt to stay.

The Han population is rising and the Tibetan language, our mother language, is losing its position among our people, said a Tibetan teacher who fled to India in January after being arrested several times for his views. The road building jobs and the construction jobs are not open to Tibetans, and young Tibetan girls are turning to prostitution.

If the Chinese wish to help Tibet, said the teacher, who asked not to be identified, They should stop the immigration and give the opportunities to local people so they can improve their lives, and we can protect our culture.

Moron,

Why not go to ask Dala who gave up the independence request recently?

The railway will be complete this year as I remember and will be used for the public transportation too. For the high attitute and low temperature, few are allowed to go there. There is no other reasons for that. Sooner or later, many have chance to take the cozy cozy train to Xizang as long as you have a good will.

Your morons cannot stop China. haha

Don't you think the title is not flaming? There is no need to keep a public project secret, let alone it will be open to service so soon. The simple reason can be understood by any people who have brain.

The railway is very high (many of them are more than 4000 meters high and There is no residents living around in most part of the railway). The special train passenger cars were ordered for the service that can adjust the air presure and temperature, the system is pretty much like a plane.

It is not. the title only questions China for is reluctance to show off a master piece in rail engineering. We are impressed in India, but wonder about the secrecy.

The project is close to completion. Only 40 km away from Lhasa.

This pic shows the oxygeon station. Workers have to stay there for 4 or 5 hurs each day. Otherwise, they will have health trouble. So you can imagine how hard the project is and how difficult to make arrangement for reporters.

Chinese official media don't post to much pics about Maglev in Shanghai. Most pics came from ordinary people or tourist. It is so easy to see the maglev in Shanghai.

The Tibet railroad is very different story. Few can go there as you can see in the pics.

Media like NY times should have a lot of resourse to access media in Chinese.

For the project, I know some westerners don't like it for political reasons. Many Indians are sensitive about it for the military reasons. But most of Tibetians welcome it. It will definitely will improve their life. For the culture protection, I think Chinese are good at this. Most of temples are maintained by central gov. Every newspaper have two versions, one in Chinese, another in Tibetan (it is not easy, since there are only about 2 million people are using it, and gov has to finance these.)

Basically, minorities in China have much more priviliges than our Han people. They are exempt from the family planning policy, priority to go to universities. Muslim students in Chinese universities even used to have a special subsidy from gov since they don't eat pork. In places, like Beijing, where there are a lot of Muslims, grocery stores are required to have to set of tools for cutting the meat. At least one set cannot be used on pork. This show the respection toward theor religion.

chicom monkeyboy seems to brainwashed in commie ideology so it is obvious that he is unable to see reason or use logic...

*shrugs off the rage...

the railway is actually good for tibetan economy and migrants are just poor poeple like the tibs.they are good workers and generally have temporary stay...they cant seem to stand the heat <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/> and chill of lhasa...i am not afraid of migrants as much as i am afraid of rich chinese tourists...lol. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

from what my relatives tell chinese people have taken to buddhism in a big way so it is good business for lamas to have rich chinese as chelas <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/rolleyes.gif"/>.just like our desi babas.....
there are loads of good monks but the foriegners always seems to choose a thief or a illitrrate fool as guru.

anyway these neorich buggers need teachers and who better than our venerable tibetan monks to lead them to the middle path.that leaves our local tibetans in need of monks...and also it makes our clergy very neutral in regards to tibetan cause...

Be realistic. Many expect China would follow USSR's path long long time ago. But today's China is more intgrated than before. Tibetans's life in Lhasa is better than what you have in India.

Dalai's brother returned to China at least twice recently. He knows what is happening in Tibet. but frankly Dalai does not have too much choice when he negotiates with gov. Maybe he can get back his position in the central gov he got in 50s.

As a Han people, I don't want to confront with a Chinese minority. I have to follow my country's policy for dealing with the minority. What I can do is telling you the truth. I suggest you go back Tibet once and see what is Tibet now. It will not hurt you, but you can get more knowledge about morden Tibet.

Chinese gov does not run the temples. But it pays for the maintenance. Profit from the temple? Are you joking? Central gov subsidies 6 billion RMB each year to Tibetan. This is the number serveral years ago. It can only be more today. If that money is distributed to 2 million Tibetans evenly, each of them can get 3000RMB. Only by this they could be richer than many in your country, Let alone, they can make money from their jobs.

I can say, all the infrastructure and big projects in Tibet were financed by central gov or with the assistance from other provinces. That's why Dalai gave up his independence request after his brother had returned China twice.

As for language, Chinese gov is doing the best to reserve Tibetan. But with more telecomm methods and for the biz reason, any language has to undertake changes. Chinese has a lot from others, for example, a lot from English (of course American English), I am sure Tibetan has the similar changes. Gov doesn't force the change. Cultural exchange always exists natuarally.

Another similar example is Hongkong. All of residents in Hongkong speak Cantonese (a branch of Chinese, Most f hongkong people are still Han). But with so many mainland Chinese travel to Hongkong, mandarin is more and more popular there since Mandarin can bring biz privilage when dealing with Chinese who only understand Mandarin.

Not only Han people are visiting or doing biz in Tibet, but also alot of Tibetans are moving to Beijing or Guangdong.

for Han people, Mandarin is requied for TV and radio programs. but For minorities who has their own writting characters, they have free choice. At least Tibetan, Vuygur, and Mongonians have their own choices.

Reserving a culture does not mean no change at all.

Tibetans have free choice of Language of either Chinese or local one in schools.

Ok, go back to the railway. At least the Tibetan here who is pro-independence knows it is GOOD for Tibetan people.

Dalai's brother returned to China at least twice recently. He knows what is happening in Tibet. but frankly Dalai does not have too much choice when he negotiates with gov. Maybe he can get back his position in the central gov he got in 50s.

As a Han people, I don't want to confront with a Chinese minority. I have to follow my country's policy for dealing with the minority. What I can do is telling you the truth. I suggest you go back Tibet once and see what is Tibet now. It will not hurt you, but you can get more knowledge about morden Tibet.

And for the record, I have nothing against China, in fact on the contrary I am a big fan of Chinese culture and history and I dont think that anyone can deny that China is ahead of India in terms of economic development, however where China lags is in having an equally prosperous private enterprise. But I guess CHina makes it up by having a Hong Kong where private enterprise is second to none.

As a recent report, private economy accounts for 2/3 of Chinese economy already.
When Chinese talk about China's economy, we exclude Hongkong since hongkong is a Special Admin Region, and it does not pay any tax to the central gov so far. I saw a report several years ago, 1/3 of the investment in Hongkong came from mainland. Macau is of the same case. Of course a lot of FDI in mainland China comes from Hongkong too.

But I think so far, state still controls the strategic industries, such as energy, iron@steel, financial services, resources, weaponary production. privatization of energy, iron@steel, financial services begins already.

This is another news from China media I happened to read. I think this could be a biotech that is important to China to ease the population burden.

The prof. Yuan Longping who is working in Hunan province has his own company. World Bank (maybe UN) and Phillipino gov asked and helped him to setup a lab in Manila to promote his tech for the hybrid rice to Philippines.

A major cotton breeding breakthrough has made China the first country in the world to commercialize a cotton strain that can resist bollworms and increase output by 25 per cent.

The milestone advancement was pioneered by scientist Guo Sandui and his team at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The breakthrough won wide acclaim from officials and experts over the weekend.

Building on his success of insect-resistant, genetically-modified cotton, of which 2.3 million hectares was planted this year, Guo's research team in 1999 started to work out a molecular breeding system for hybrid cotton.

After years of hard work, Guo, the "father of Chinese Bt transgenetic cotton," was able to have his "Yinmian 2" cotton strain approved by the National Crop Cultivar Assessment Committee, which gave the go-ahead for its commercialization, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.

The "three-line hybrid cotton with insect-resistant gene," if planted on the 3.33 million hectares of land where it is fit to grow, will theoretically increase output by 1 million tons each year.

That amounts to what conventional strains may be able to yield on 666,600 hectares, which is the equivalent size of all the cotton fields in the Yangtze River Delta, a leading cotton producer in China, Vice-Minister of Agriculture Fan Xiaojian said on Saturday.

With this remark, Fan was apparently pointing to the technology's potential power to ease the country's land allocation conflict between grain and cotton crops.

The "three lines" refer to the male-sterile, maintenance and restorer lines in cotton breeding.

Through genetic engineering and conventional breeding, Chinese scientists have manipulated these lines to ensure a hybrid cotton strain that maintains and multiples hybrid heterosis, leading to high quality and high yields, said Zhang Rui, one of Guo's aides.

In addition, the strain's insect resistance efficiency is more than 90 per cent, Zhang said.

Guo's "Yinmian 2" and other strains in the pipeline will enable China to use less acreage to reach its cotton production goals, leaving more cropland for grain production, Fan said.

Fan and a group of government officials and experts inspected Guo's experimental base in Beijing's Pinggu District on Saturday.

The United States began "three-line hybrid cotton" research in 1948, but has failed to find a solution to ensure a desirably high yield of hybrid cotton, let alone a hybrid one with pest-resistance.

Other major cotton growers, such as India, develop hybrid cotton through a laborious inefficient manual breeding method, according to Guo.

Yuan Longping, the world's "father of hybrid rice," said on Saturday he had visited both the US and India to see their hybrid cotton breeding in the 1980s and 1990s.

"I believe China's 'three-line hybrid cotton with insect-resistant gene' is really a world-leading breakthrough," Yuan told China Daily. "Even in its initial stage, it can boost cotton production by 25 per cent. This is a great feat."

Compared with his "hybrid rice" which promises to increase grain output by up to 20 per cent, Yuan said Guo's hybrid cotton is well on course to increase output by 30 per cent in the years to come.

The senior scientist urged the ministries of agriculture, science and technology as well as the National Development and Reform Commission to shore up investment and spread the technology nationwide to benefit farmers.

On the potential environmental side-effects of genetically engineered crops, Luo Bin, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture, said only genetically modified strains assessed as safe are granted certificates for commercialization.

However, monitoring should continue after a new crop is certified and spread to large areas of land, he said.

Vice-Minister Fan said his ministry will work to translate the "encouraging technology" into productivity as soon as possible.

He noted domestic demand for cotton has been on the rise in recent years, while imports keep flooding in.

Last year, market demand for cotton grew by 1.5 million tons, hitting 8.75 million tons. Imports surged to a record 1.98 million tons, he said.

667Medic,

This is another biotech news. I saw this first time. Kind of strange.

Experts at the robot research centre in Shandong Technology University controlled white mice by stimulating micro-electrodes on their heads.

The mice obeyed computer-generated commands to, in succession, "turn left", "turn right" and "move forward".

Project manager Su Xuecheng said animal robot research is the merger of electronic communication and biology, creating a new scientific discipline.

Scientists believe it will eventually lead to new ways of curing disabilities as electronic signals are used to replace damaged nerves.
