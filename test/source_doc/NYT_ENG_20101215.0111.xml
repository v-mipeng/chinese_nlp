RULING IS UPHELD AGAINST EXECUTIVES TIED TO OXYCONTIN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal district judge in Washington has upheld the disbarment
of three former top executives of the company that made the
prescription painkiller OxyContin, ruling that they should still be
prohibited from involvement in any government-financed health care
program.
</P>
<P>
In the decision Monday, U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle
refused an effort by the former officials of the company, Purdue
Pharma, to overturn the current ban and would not reduce the
12-year duration of the ban. The three individuals involved are
Michael Friedman, Purdue Pharma's former chief executive; Howard
Udell, its former top lawyer; and Dr. Paul Goldenheim, who was once
its chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
James Heins, a spokesman for Purdue Pharma, which is based in
Stamford, Conn., said the company had no comment on the ruling. But
the law firm Hogan Lovells, which is representing the men,
expressed disappointment in the decision. "We continue to believe
that the government has exceeded its statutory powers in imposing
exclusion, and our clients plan to appeal this ruling," the firm
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In 2007, Purdue Frederick, an affiliate of Purdue Pharma, and
the three men pleaded guilty to criminal charges that the company
had misled doctors and patients by claiming for five years that
OxyContin was less prone to abuse than similar drugs because it was
a long-acting narcotic.
</P>
<P>
For their part, each of the three executives pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor charge related to his service as a "responsible
corporate officer" during the period in question. That charge
holds that an executive has a duty to know about the actions of
subordinates and that the executive must move to stop any
wrongdoing upon learning of it.
</P>
<P>
The executives have contended that they were unaware that Purdue
Pharma sales officials were misrepresenting the drug, whose
widespread availability touched off a wave of abuse and addiction
in many states. During those years, OxyContin brought in billions
of dollars in sales to the company.
</P>
<P>
After their pleas, the Department of Health and Human Services
barred the three men for 20 years from doing business with Medicare
or other taxpayer-financed health care programs. But since then,
they have brought several administrative and legal actions seeking
to have their ban overturned and were successful in getting the ban
reduced to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
In her decision, Segal Huvelle rejected the executives' argument
that their disbarment should be overturned because their
convictions resulted simply from their status as senior executives
at Purdue, rather than from their conduct.
</P>
<P>
"Plaintiffs appear to misunderstand or misstate the basic
elements of their conviction," the judge wrote.
