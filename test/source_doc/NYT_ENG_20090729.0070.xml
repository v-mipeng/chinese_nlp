Jia Zhang-Ke is, like it or not, one of the world's most
important directors.
</P>
<P>
Those that like it admire his carefully made films (especially
"Platform" and "The World") and original approach to observing
a China that might be losing a part of its identity as it
transitions to Western economic and cultural values. Those that
don't would rather watch paint dry than another one of his
bore-fests.
</P>
<P>
"24 City" won't change the minds of detractors -- it is his
most painfully slow yet -- but it might change the minds of his
supporters, including this critic, for Jia attempts something that
is, in the end, unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
Purportedly a documentary of a state-run factory closing near
Chengdu City and how it affects its former workers, "24 City"
mixes honest interviews of real people who worked at the factory
for decades with interviews of actors playing former workers. The
trouble is, Jia does not indicate which is documentary and which is
acting (only the San Francisco actress Joan Chen, playing, no
kidding, a factory worker who looks like Joan Chen, would be
recognizable to a sizable portion of Western viewers).
</P>
<P>
In other words, half of this movie -- four of the nine people
interviewed are actors -- is a big lie.
</P>
<P>
Why does Jia do this? The film has lovely, almost fetishistic
images of the factory, courtesy of cinematographer Yu Lik-wai, that
recalls the industrial images in the excellent 2006 documentary
"Manufactured Landscapes."
</P>
<P>
It is also at times a touching portrait of a culture in flux.
One woman, now in her 50s and out of work, heartbreakingly
observes, "If you have something to do, you age more slowly."
She, of course, has nothing to do and feels her life slipping away.
</P>
<P>
Such truth makes it all the more embarrassing when an actor
tries to capture the same emotion -- and this is no knock against
the actors. It's just that it comes off lame by comparison, and
takes the viewer completely out of the film.
