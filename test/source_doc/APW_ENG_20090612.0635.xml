Developers who wanted to build a glass-and-steel tower on the site of a former army barracks in London say they have abandoned their plans after Prince Charles opposed them.

<P>
The Qatari royal family is funding the redevelopment of the Chelsea Barracks through the company Project Blue (Guernsey) Ltd. and had hired architect Richard Rogers to design a modern tower on the site.

<P>
British media reported that Charles contacted the Qatari royal family to persuade them to rethink the design.

Project Blue said in a statement Friday that it had withdrawn its planning application for the site. The statement added that developers would work with Prince Charles' architectural charity, The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment, to draw up new plans.
