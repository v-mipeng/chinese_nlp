WHITE ' S INFLUENCE SHOWS AT SNOWBOARD FINAL

<P>
Shaun White was a no-show in the halfpipe at the
U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships. But several riders
demonstrated his influence during the men's halfpipe finals on a
warm, sunny Saturday afternoon here in the Green Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Two competitors performed 1260 aerial spins, rotating
three-and-a-half times. And all three riders on the podium
performed double cork 1080s -- inverted aerials while spinning
two-and-a-half times that only a handful of riders have mastered.
</P>
<P>
White was the first to perform variations of both maneuvers in
competition earlier this season in a push toward the Olympics in
Vancouver, where he won a gold medal in the halfpipe.
</P>
<P>
In the men's halfpipe final, Kazuhiro Kokubo performed three
1080s consecutively during his winning run for a score of 97.17. It
was the first victory at the Open for Kokubo, a 21-year-old from
Japan. In January he won a bronze medal at the Winter X Games.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back on this season, it was so good, with the best
results of my career," Kokubu said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
Louie Vito, a member of the U.S. snowboard team at the Vancouver
Games, finished in second place with a score of 96.17 on his first
of three runs. Vito performed three 1080 spins, but not
consecutively. On his final run, Vito finished with a flat-spin
1260, but the move was not enough to raise his score.
</P>
<P>
"This is the Olympic year," Vito said about the next
generation of progressive maneuvers, including double corks. "The
riding just skyrockets. You definitely want to be on the front of
that charge."
</P>
<P>
Iouri Podladtchikov of Switzerland was third with a score of
96.0 during his first run, in which he landed a double McTwist
1260, an off-axis double flip while spinning three rotations. It
was White's signature move, and he was the only competitor in
Vancouver to land one.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Podladtchikov, who finished second to White at
the Winter X Games in January, had learned it, too. When he won the
Winter X Games Europe in Tignes, France, last week with a run that
included a Double McTwist 1260, he set up an anticipated showdown
with White this week.
</P>
<P>
But White withdrew from competition earlier Saturday, the second
year in a row he has pulled out of the U.S. Open at the last
moment. In 2009 he was unable to compete due to an ankle injury. On
Saturday morning he failed to show up for the semifinals. Officials
at the Open issued a statement shortly afterward: "Unfortunately,
Shaun White is exhausted and not feeling well enough to compete in
today's U.S. Open halfpipe event."
</P>
<P>
On Friday White said that this week had been the first time he
had ridden his snowboard since the Olympic men's halfpipe finals
Feb. 17. In the meantime he had been traveling the world on a media
tour, and skateboarding in Los Angeles near his home in Carlsbad,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States Open signals the end of the
competitive snowboard season, White had already moved on mentally
to skateboarding, his summertime diversion, in which he is also a
top competitor.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, White said he was having a difficult time finding the
motivation to continue snowboarding, at least in the immediate
future.
</P>
<P>
"It's skate time," he said, describing plans for the
competitive skateboard season and new tricks, including a 1080, a
maneuver that has never been landed in a skateboarding competition.
</P>
<P>
In the women's final, Kelly Clark won a record fourth halfpipe
title. The 26-year-old Clark, who grew up in nearby West Dover,
Vt., has been competing at the U.S. Open for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"I put in a lot of work heading into Vancouver," said Clark,
who won bronze at the Olympics last month, "trying to make sure my
riding is where I want it to be."
</P>
<P>
On her winning run, Clark soared higher than the rest of the
women's field and performed back-to-back 720 spins (two rotations)
for a score of 94.17. Kaitlyn Farrington finished second with a
score of 90.33, followed by Ellery Hollingsworth with an 86.33.
</P>
<P>
Like the men's halfpipe final, the women's field also lacked
some star power. The defending U.S. Open halfpipe champion Torah
Bright, who won the women's halfpipe gold medal in Vancouver,
elected not to travel to Vermont to rest at home in Utah.
</P>
<P>
But Clark added some sizzle. Her final run, a victory lap, was
reminiscent of the men's competition, when she attempted a 1080, a
move no woman has landed in competition.
</P>
<P>
Clark did not make it, but the effort was appreciated.
