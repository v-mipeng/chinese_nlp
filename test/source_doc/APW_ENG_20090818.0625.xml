An airport more than 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) from Britain's capital has been renamed London Oxford, leaving some scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the airport near Oxford said the decision to re-brand it two weeks ago was made to raise awareness of its existence.
</P>
<P>
"We want to wave our flag to the global business aviation community and say 'We exist' as an alternative airport in the northwest of London," marketing manager James Dillon-Godfray said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The airport, on the outskirts of the village of Kidlington, serves business customers, private plane owners and a flying school.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond Europe, in the trans-Atlantic and Middle-Eastern marketplace, people are unaware of our capabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the decision has not swayed local campaigners.
</P>
<P>
"I have no objections to expanding the airport, but it seems rather bizarre to use the London label. You might as well call it Oxford International," said Gordon Balme, of the Oxford Civic Society, a campaign group for Oxford residents.
</P>
<P>
"Oxford is a beautiful and world-famous medieval city. It doesn't need to have London attached to it," he said. "Good luck to them if they can get away with it without raising ire of the people of Kidlington."
</P>
<P>
Tony Joyce, the group's chairman, labeled the name-change as misleading. "If you land here in Oxford expecting to reach London you'll have a hell of a time," he said. "I can't understand it at all. It's silly and quite inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
Dillon-Godfray is quick to point out that the airports location makes little difference. "Its not about distance, but drive time. The M40 (the highway linking Oxford and London) is the least congested motorway," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the airport is not trying to compete with London's major international airports, Heathrow and Gatwick.
