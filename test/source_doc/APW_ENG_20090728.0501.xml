Bank of America Corp.'s CEO Ken Lewis said he is planning to shrink the bank's 6,100-branch network by about 10 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Lewis told investors of the plans at a meeting last week in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the bank's headquarters are located. The Journal cited unidentified people familiar with the discussion.
</P>
<P>
The move would be a pullback from the bank's two-decade expansion, most recently under Lewis' command, which expanded the bank from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
A Bank of America spokesman could not be reached for immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
Shares of Bank of America fell 1.5 percent in premarket trading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said it was told Liam McGee, president of Bank of America's consumer and small-business bank, cited changing customer preferences for the move, saying more people are using online and mobile banking.
</P>
<P>
McGee, however, reportedly said it would be premature to specify how many locations could be closed.
</P>
<P>
The report comes as Bank of America continues to be under the careful watch of the U.S. government, while it works to integrate two recent deals.
</P>
<P>
Bank of America acquired troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. last summer and investment bank Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in January.
</P>
<P>
Those two acquisitions have proven challenging for Lewis, who was stripped of his chairman title by a shareholder vote at his company's annual meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
The bank and Lewis have been under intense scrutiny because Bank of America is one of the biggest recipients of government bailout money -- $45 billion -- and because the losses at Merrill Lynch turned out to be much higher than expected. It is not known when it will repay the government.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Bank of America has become a financial powerhouse befitting of its name.
</P>
<P>
First under chief executive Hugh McColl Jr., and since 2001 under Lewis, the bank has grown through acquisition from a little North Carolina National Bank into a behemoth consumer bank.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, the bank acquired FleetBoston Financial, a move that gave Bank of America $133 billion in deposits in eight Northeastern states. Three years ago it added millions of names to its customer ledger through the purchase of credit card issuer MBNA Corp.
</P>
<P>
In 2007, the bank completed its purchase of wealth management company U.S. Trust and acquired LaSalle Bank Corp., immediately turning Lewis' bank into the market leader in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of giant home lender Countrywide last year brought Bank of America to the forefront of the mortgage business, and the Merrill Lynch deal bought bank a large presence back on Wall Street.
