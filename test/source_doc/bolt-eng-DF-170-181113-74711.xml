The economy is still in the dumps and likely to get worse. Unemployment is growing, foreclosures are increasing, the stock market is ready to tank, and our debt is skyrocketing. This thread is about the economic reality that we are facing.

ASHINGTON (AP) -- The mortgage crisis is dragging on the economic recovery as more homeowners fall behind on their payments.

Analysts expect improvement soon, but the number of homeowners in default or at risk of foreclosure will have a lingering effect on the broader economy.

More than 10 percent of homeowners with a mortgage had missed at least one payment in the January-March period, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday. That's a record high and up from 9.1 percent a year ago.

A great many of the teachers who have been labeled as non productive have been given starting jobs in the inner city ghettos and told that they have to teach the 83 average percentile IQ students to achieve at reading and math proficiency as if they were average IQ students.

Most 83 IQ students can not learn to read above a third grade level. Telling a beginning teacher that they do not measure up when they are asked to do the impossible is cruel and unusual punishment. We should sterilize people with IQ's that low so they do not breed.

Good genes are good genes. MY Great Grandfather was the World famous naturalist Berthold Neubarth. My mother's father was a doctor. Her brother was a doctor. My father was a doctor. My mother was president of her class in college and editor of her school newspaper. Very capable minds usually produce children who are equally capable. I had the highest SAT score in my high school class yet enlisted in the Navy out of high school because we were in the Vietnam War and I wanted to serve.

I retired at 51, a millionaire.

I left the Navy after having spent 12 years of my life in service to my country (You do not get rich that way.) So, even though I had orders to Naval Post Graduate School, I quit a very successful naval officer career to become a manager with Pacific Bell Telephone. 18 years later in 2000 I retired. I have used my funds to raise children 90 percent of whom were not mine. We just took them in off of the streets.

Instead of watching mindless drivel on television every night, I read and learn. I have done so all of my adult life. My family motto for all of my 30+ children has been, "Learn as much as you can about everything!"

All of my children have done so and are very well rounded individuals. You can take average potential kids and turn them into A students. I have proven that many, many times. Sadly, you can not take stupid and turn them into honor students. You have to start with some potential. If you are starting with an 85 or lower IQ, you are lucky if you can teach them to read with limited understanding. That does not mean that you can not teach them to work.

Zander, that is the stupidest thing you have posted to date and it is an outrageous lie.

Eugenics has never been responsible for millions of deaths. War has, but not eugenics which is usually defined as intelligent breeding. Retarded people with IQ's below 90 produce retarded children with fantastic consistency. That is a scientific fact. Low IQ in equals low IQ out.

If you are too fucking stupid to know that, I suggest you read a little. It is idiotic ignorant attitudes like yours that have given us city cores where the average IQ of the school students is below 85. We have millions of retarded people in our major cities all across the nation. Most of those retarded parents are on social security because they can not function in society. They are breeding at an alarming rate and millions of them are set up by the system in our inner cities. In Detroit they are averaging 5.3 children per female. As soon as the kids reach 18 they are put on social security and they start breeding again at the same alarming rate.

Every dozen years we double our numbers of retarded on Social Security. It is because the system is breeding a race of retarded who have only one function in the Social Security system, and that is to breed. We need to sterilize them so they do not breed.

That is eugenics. It is practical and reasonable and there is nothing wrong with it. We do not need to be producing "welfare mothers" by the millions every year. If they are too dumb to work, they should not be breeding. If you want them to breed for your perverse amusement, then you can pay for them and watch them all you want. I think paying them to breed endless generations of retards with our public money is a waste.

More Economic REALITY. Leading economic indicators drop. If you think this is bad, wait until next months report.........

<quote>
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Leading-indicators-drop-01-apf-251256909.html?x=0&amp;sec=topStories&amp;pos=main&amp;asset=91975ca49d5809a45482e8ec208f0811&amp;ccode=rd">Leading indicators drop 0.1 percent in April - Yahoo! Finance</a>
NEW YORK (AP) -- A private research group's index of leading economic indicators unexpectedly slipped in April, its first drop in more than a year and a sign that growth could slow this summer.

The Conference Board said its gauge of future economic activity edged down 0.1 percent last month, the first decline since March 2009. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a gain of 0.2 percent.

The index is designed to forecast economic activity in the next three to six months.

The decline "suggests a recovery that will continue through summer, although it could lose a little steam," said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board.

While the recovery from the recession has spread more broadly through the U.S. economy this spring, a big drop-off in plans to build homes and a debt crisis in Europe may have weighed on growth, discouraging employers from hiring.

The research group also revised its March growth estimate to 1.3 percent, slightly less than the 1.4 percent growth it had previously estimated.

Six of the index's 10 components deteriorated in April. The biggest drags on the index: U.S. residents filed fewer applications to build homes, vendors were slower in delivering supplies to companies, the unemployed filed more claims for jobless aid and consumers' confidence dropped.

Four components improved, including higher stock prices, on average; a sharper difference between overnight and 10-year borrowing costs, historically a positive signal; more hours worked in factories and an increase in manufacturers' orders for capital goods.

<quote>
WASHINGTON  The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week by the largest amount in three months. The surge is evidence of how volatile the job market remains, even as the economy grows.

Applications for unemployment benefits rose to 471,000 last week, up by 25,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the first increase in five weeks and the biggest jump since a gain of 40,000 in February.

The total was the highest since new claims reached 480,000 on April 10. It also pushed the average for the last four weeks to 453,500.

Alas, boedicca, you do not understand that money spent on the massive welfare state that we have created in the past thirty years is money that is not being spent on infrastructure that would keep our economy strong. The collapsing infrastructure is costing us jobs by the millions.

When it comes to the economy, do we need to sacrifice it to put twenty million more on Social Security at the age of 18 because they are the children of retarded Social Security parents who were the children of retarded Social Security parents who were the children of the original Welfare mothers that we put on Social Security so we could claim that we had reduced the welfare rolls in states all across the nation?

Do you have any idea how many hundreds of billions will be spent on this growing mass of retarded citizens all living off of the public teat in the major cities all across this land. It quite frankly is our major growing economic problem in America right now. Ignoring it will not make it go away, even if you squeeze your eyes shut as hard as you can. The problem will still be there and growing.

As you should know by now, Zander that did not happen. Unemployment claims actually went down as reported by the states. We are in the period that I told you people was coming when the Goldman Sachs boys want to bring the market down to capitalize on their derivative investments.

Witness actual UI claims are falling. The Euro is still above its average against the dollar. I remember when ninety cents American could buy a Euro. Now, it takes $1.22 to buy a Euro. From this they get the sheeple to panic. Ha! Yet, the sheeple do panic because they always believe what they are told.

It used to be that a fifth rate country like Guatemala or Greece defaulting on their loans would not have mattered to the major markets of the world.

All it was was another fifth rate country failing to understand finance.

Happens all the time in the fifth rate country world.

Now, all of a sudden the sheeple are told that they are supposed to panic because Greece might be thrown out of the Euro consortium. So the sheeple panic. I have protected my investments in anticipation of what the sheeple will do once thus stimulated. It amazes me that people can be so stupid all of the time. Goldman Sachs can get them to do anything.

US money supply plunges at 1930s pace as Obama eyes fresh stimulus

The M3 money supply in the United States is contracting at an accelerating rate that now matches the average decline seen from 1929 to 1933, despite near zero interest rates and the biggest fiscal blitz in history.
</quote>
The money supply is shrinking......last time this happened was the last time we had massive government intrusion on the free markets - the Great Depression...

<quote>
The M3 figures - which include broad range of bank accounts and are tracked by British and European monetarists for warning signals about the direction of the US economy a year or so in advance - began shrinking last summer. The pace has since quickened.

The stock of money fell from $14.2 trillion to $13.9 trillion in the three months to April, amounting to an annual rate of contraction of 9.6pc. The assets of insitutional money market funds fell at a 37pc rate, the sharpest drop ever. "It’s frightening," said Professor Tim Congdon from International Monetary Research. "The plunge in M3 has no precedent since the Great Depression. The dominant reason for this is that regulators across the world are pressing banks to raise capital asset ratios and to shrink their risk assets. This is why the US is not recovering properly," he said.

The US authorities have an entirely different explanation for the failure of stimulus measures to gain full traction. They are opting instead for yet further doses of Keynesian spending, despite warnings from the IMF that the gross public debt of the US will reach 97pc of GDP next year and 110pc by 2015.

I doubt that the congress will pass any such stimulus prior to the election. If the Republicans gain control of either house it will have to pass in a lameduck session over GOP filibuster in the Senate which would be a nightmare scenario for the DNC. So while I agree the administration wants to do this they ain't going to be able to do this.

Commendable life, there Neibarth.

But teach them to do what kind of work?

Seriously, so many of the jobs they might have been able to do -- jobs that might have kept them solvent and off welfare rolls -- have migrated offshore or are being taken by illegals.

Besides, teachers in elementary and Junior high don't give people employment skills, they teach them academics.

At best people start getting technical training at the HS level.

FREE TRADE is a disaster precisely because it makes so many formerly productive members of our society dedundant.

And reducdant workers go from being an asset to this society to a net deficiet to this society.

And when we have enough of those displaced workers on food stampts and such, then guess what happens?

Tax revenues fall, even at the same time government spending has to rise to deal with these displaced and now basically unemployable, workers.

Dumb policies like FREE TRADE are what's killing our economy.

The verdict is in. Paying people to sit on their ass &amp; not produce does not add any real sustainable GDP. It only creates debt + interest = DEFAULT &amp; CURRENCY CRISIS.

Had the stimulus money went for real assets that returned real product &amp; value, we would not be in this situation. Paying for political favors &amp; votes has doomed this country.

The M3 money supply will continue to decline while the M1 currency rises causing a global currency crisis. You people may think that our currency is strengthening but it is falling. It is only strengthening against most other paper currencies of the world that are worse off than ours. Most investments will no longer keep up with real future inflation rates. This will deter more investment &amp; encourage hording of assets.

The official U.S. debt now stands at 90.36373% of GDP.

Greece National Debt hit the point of no return at 115% of GDP.

If you include Fannie &amp; Freddie the current US debt to GDP ratio is currently very close to 115%. If we do not end the government backed pensions, or stop Fannie &amp; Freddie then we are Greece.

The numbers on our federal debt are becoming frighteningly familiar. The debt is projected to equal 140 percent of gross domestic product within two decades. Add in the budget troubles of state governments, and the true shortfall grows even larger.

The verdict is in. Paying people to sit on their ass &amp; not produce does not add any real sustainable GDP. It only creates debt + interest = DEFAULT &amp; CURRENCY CRISIS.

Had the stimulus money went for real assets that returned real product &amp; value, we would not be in this situation. Paying for political favors &amp; votes has doomed this country.

lets us argue the case rather than declare a foregone conclusion as to how economies like ours work, or fail to.

i'll start by arguing that your inflationary currency crisis is not real, and is the opposite of what is actually happening in our economy at present. furthermore, sustainable GDP is utopian mythology, and i believe that nothing will bring that about. lastly, i dont concur entirely with what stimulus spending decisions have been made, but i simply dont understand what you are implying with your real asset investment idea.

i see our economy to be in a deflationary spiral exacerbated by lack of demand resulting from near stagflationary credit availability, fear of job security, and a reduction in middle-class incomes due to under-/un-employment. what would throwing 'assets that returned real product &amp; value' at that situation do, other than drive down said value due to the function of the supply/demand mechanism?

<quote>
The M3 money supply will continue to decline while the M1 currency rises causing a global currency crisis. You people may think that our currency is strengthening but it is falling. It is only strengthening against most other paper currencies of the world that are worse off than ours. Most investments will no longer keep up with real future inflation rates. This will deter more investment &amp; encourage hording of assets.
</quote>
can you expand on the mechanism of your money supply crisis? it is blurry to me. is there a reason you feel the M3 wont reverse? what about the fed's eventual disposition on all of those assets they've snatched up? does your model account for those and their role as the economy begins to expand, and they are re-introduced? have you considered the weight of the chinese economy on the dollar, and that the indications of their breakaway are inflationary?

More Reality.....1st qtr growth is revised downward.... <a href="http://news.morningstar.com/newsnet/ViewNews.aspx?article=/DJ/201005271113DOWJONESDJONLINE000560_univ.xml">UPDATE: US 1Q GDP Growth Revised Down, Weekly Jobless Claims Fall</a>

<quote>
Gross domestic product increased by a 3.0% annual rate January through March, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The growth figure was revised down from an initial 3.2% estimate from a month ago, and is below the 3.4% rate expected among economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.

The economic expansion has also slowed from the 5.6% increase in GDP recorded in the fourth quarter. But the October-December surge was largely due to technical changes involving inventories and not consumer spending, a fundamental part of the U.S. economy that accounts for about two-thirds of GDP

More warning signs -

Credit swap spreads - were at 9.6 basis points in March. they are now at 64 basis points. This is a crisis indicator that rises when banks are more leery of doing business with each other. They charge higher premiums at times when they're worried about credit quality and extreme volatility.

Libor rates - The 3-month, dollar-based LIBOR has more than doubled to 54 basis points from 25 points in December. LIBOR costs rise as banks price in the risk that the people they're lending to won't be able to pay them back.

Bottom line - We're already seeing the stock market begin to crack. But the declines so far could be just a walk in the park compared to what lies ahead. Be prepared. Cut back your exposure to Stocks and Corporate Bonds.

But teach them to do what kind of work?

Seriously, so many of the jobs they might have been able to do -- jobs that might have kept them solvent and off welfare rolls -- have migrated offshore or are being taken by illegals.

Besides, teachers in elementary and Junior high don't give people employment skills, they teach them academics.

At best people start getting technical training at the HS level.

FREE TRADE is a disaster precisely because it makes so many formerly productive members of our society dedundant.

And reducdant workers go from being an asset to this society to a net deficiet to this society.

And when we have enough of those displaced workers on food stampts and such, then guess what happens?

Tax revenues fall, even at the same time government spending has to rise to deal with these displaced and now basically unemployable, workers.

Dumb policies like FREE TRADE are what's killing our economy.

Indeed, free trade is a very dumb policy. Allowing the Communist Chinese to peg their currency to the dollar is a very dumb policy, too. If we had a president with balls, he would have done something about that well over a year ago. So far, nothing! Only promises from the State Department.

Free Trade? Ha, if I were president, I'd shut the door on China overnight until they floated their currency. We have the right to the driver's seat, but we don't have a driver.

Sell your stocks and bonds people, move to cash or short term treasuries. We are about to enter a wave 3 downturn - it will be fast and furious...........

<quote>
May 28 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks slid, capping the worst May for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1940, while the euro slumped and Treasuries rose as a downgrade of Spains debt rating and escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula triggered a flight from riskier assets.

The Dow tumbled 122.36 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,136.63 at 4 p.m. in New York and lost 7.9 percent this month. The Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index sank 1.2 percent to 1,089.41, led by financial shares on the Spanish downgrade and energy companies after U.S. President Barack Obama extended a moratorium on new deep-water drilling. Oil erased gains after rallying as much as 1.6 percent to more than $75 a barrel. Ten-year Treasury yields decreased 7 basis points to 3.3 percent. The euro slipped 0.7 percent to $1.2273.

Equities and commodities extended losses after Fitch Ratings stripped Spain of the AAA rating its held since 2003, saying the nations economic growth will slow as it attempts to cut its debts. Earlier losses followed disappointing U.S. economic data and a North Korean generals warning of all-out war if any accidental clashes with South Korea break out.

Spains downgrade just adds to more uncertainty, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Newark, New Jersey- based Prudential Financial Inc., which oversees about $667 billion. There are too many geopolitical events. We have a three-day weekend in the U.S., and traders will definitely want to lighten their books.

Yet the latest GDP report from the U.S. Department of Commerce shows that the 3.2 percent first-quarter economic growth rate got no help from government spending.

In fact, combined federal, state, and local spending actually fell 1.8 percent. Whats more, over the last three quarters of a mild V-shaped recovery, with an average quarterly rebound of 3.7 percent, government spending actually exerted a small net drag (-0.03%) on growth.

did your brilliant editorialist make a little chart accounting for the role government spending played in QI 2009 and QII 2009? at that juncture, government input was virtually all there was to turn around the economy - about 6 points. did he in his wisdom consider the monetary implications of government expenditure? well, that wouldn't be a pre-digested over-simplified conclusion for gullible, ignorant skeptics to consume.

of course the recovery will be of the private sector's making, but selective acknowledgment of the role the government plays sets low marks for this kudlow's credibility. as for fish like yourself that bite, it sets marks for intellect. he argues that where government spending declined, that it didn't contribute to the latest growth. captain obvious strikes again. on the basis of that argument alone, he's concluded that government shouldn't increase spending in a recession. you bought it. what can i say?

I think Paulie's choice of words, "no effect in the first quarter" was not what he was trying to convey. Of course government had an effect, its just that it didn't contribute to economic growth.

There is no doubt in my mind that the government actions at the beginning of the recession mitigated the recession, in two ways. First, the actions of the Fed and the Treasury to backstop the financial system avoided a repeat of the Great Depression. Second, the automatic stabilizers built into the budget cushioned the decline. The former was more important than the latter IMHO.

The fact that government didn't contribute to Q1 growth is a positive as it shows that the private sector is beginning to recover. There are still serious problems in the economy, however, and we are liable to have subpar growth for some time, maybe even slip back into recession.

As previously stated, the Government spending of money did have an effect on GDP. Hell, we are a Service Sector Economy. Any government spending will result in positive GDP being added to the economy. The only problem is that it is not lasting. We need to create lasting jobs. I favor farming jobs so we can put all of these illegals to work. They are also net additive to our GDP. Besides very few city slickers would be willing to work in dirt. Bring the water west and put millions of more acres under cultivation. DO IT NOW.

i think that the selection of the first quarter 2010 to base an argument against government spending is a method widely called spin, toro. paulie mentioned it because a spinstar economist based his editorial on it.

i'd agree that the fed's action was most crucial to the recovery, but looking at targeted spending, from the cash for clunkers to the extension of unemployment benefits, tangible contirbutions to the demand base were contributed by the government. shoring up this base helped to prevent further reactions to low consumer demand: increased layoffs and downsizing, weariness among investors, etc.

the objective is not to set the economy back to peak performance exclusively on the government's bill, but the intention is to veer it off a collision course with depression. hard to say if what we've recovered so far might stick, or if some of the lagging effects and future hurdles may drag us back below par growth. nevertheless, it is crystal clear some folks don't understand how the government can and has played a roll in our recovery (or decline) and are quick to snap up spin laid for simpletons such as paulie has. end of the day: i wouldn't post any swiss cheese like that kudlow garbage, unless for a joke.

Why? Greece is on the verge of default, Dubai had to be bailed out by Abu Dhabi, Lithuania and Ireland have had to make extremely deep cuts to their budgets, and the world's governments have transferred the liabilities of their financial sectors to their own balance sheets.

I think Paulie's choice of words, "no effect in the first quarter" was not what he was trying to convey. Of course government had an effect, its just that it didn't contribute to economic growth.

There is no doubt in my mind that the government actions at the beginning of the recession mitigated the recession, in two ways. First, the actions of the Fed and the Treasury to backstop the financial system avoided a repeat of the Great Depression. Second, the automatic stabilizers built into the budget cushioned the decline. The former was more important than the latter IMHO.

The fact that government didn't contribute to Q1 growth is a positive as it shows that the private sector is beginning to recover. There are still serious problems in the economy, however, and we are liable to have subpar growth for some time, maybe even slip back into recession.
</quote>
i think that the selection of the first quarter 2010 to base an argument against government spending is a method widely called spin, toro. paulie mentioned it because a spinstar economist based his editorial on it.

i'd agree that the fed's action was most crucial to the recovery, but looking at targeted spending, from the cash for clunkers to the extension of unemployment benefits, tangible contirbutions to the demand base were contributed by the government. shoring up this base helped to prevent further reactions to low consumer demand: increased layoffs and downsizing, weariness among investors, etc.

the objective is not to set the economy back to peak performance exclusively on the government's bill, but the intention is to veer it off a collision course with depression. hard to say if what we've recovered so far might stick, or if some of the lagging effects and future hurdles may drag us back below par growth. nevertheless, it is crystal clear some folks don't understand how the government can and has played a roll in our recovery (or decline) and are quick to snap up spin laid for simpletons such as paulie has. end of the day: i wouldn't post any swiss cheese like that kudlow garbage, unless for a joke.
</quote>
Well we all have our economic ideologies. Even your point makes a great case for cancelling any additional "stimulus" spending from the government from here on out.

I still choose for my children not to have to foot the bill for a bunch of idiotic mistakes made by their generational predecessors.

You want government spending of this magnitude because you can't stomach a correction that should be YOUR responsibility. You'd rather kick that can down the road to our children.
</quote>
i only make a case that the right tool for the job is used. if the private sector has all the tools at hand, maybe the economy can float the recovery on it's own, entirely. wobbly at the knees as it is, it is not indicated that a half billion of austerity would benefit today's economy or our kid's any more than a half-billion of stimulus. that i make a case for halting any further stimulus arbitrarily might be another stretched conclusion.

as for stomach and responsibility, i've not defaulted on any credit and have paid a couple hundred grand in taxes the last ten years. i dont feel responsible for any of this bullshit. i have backed the dollar with my investment of time and money, and contributed above the average to the produce which puts the US atop world economies. the government and institutions like the fed have a responsibility and the wherewithal to steward the economy, overall. when shit goes haywire, i expect ass and elbows on their behalf to shore it up. history has indicated disaster for foreign and domesic economies where governments failed to meet the responsibility to plug the dike in times of recession. there's a massive correction if you haven't noticed, paulie. we've escaped depression thus far. are we responsible for enduring that?

as for chicken little and the fate of my kids, the debt undertaken to pull off WWII certainly didn't put a damper on the baby-boomer's odds for success. i'll inform my kids that their lot will be one of their own making, independent of the weather or the economy, thanks.

The question is not whether or not America is going to default. The question is what is the probability of a default?

I do not believe that the US is going to default, but I believe that the market is underpricing the risk of a default. If the market thinks the odds are 5%, then I think it is higher, maybe 15%. That still means that I don't think the US will default but it is higher than most people believe.

The reason is simply because the math does not work. We already have a high amount of debt, we have accelerating liabilities in social security and medicare, and we are piling on more liabilities with this administration. Either taxes have to go up significantly and/or spending and entitlements have to be slashed drastically.

Having seen similar crises in other countries - and I mean developed countries, such as New Zealand, Canada and the UK - what must first happen is that the country must be pushed to the brink, and a realization and consensus that something must be done must come to the populace. America is nowhere near that point. If that consensus never comes, America will default on its debt.

I am optimistic that Americans will eventually come to that consensus, but I am less optimistic than I was a few years ago. People are becoming more, not less ideologically strident. That is a recipe for failure. I am not an American. I always assumed that I would eventually become an American citizen, but after watching the political dialogue over the past few years, I am now for the first time reconsidering nationalization. As a Canadian, I am not taxed on my worldwide income. Americans are. If a consensus is not reached, then bad things are going to happen in this country, and it may be best that I re-locate to the Caymans or Bermuda to avoid the financial chaos that could ensue. I don't think that will happen, but I am now considering that it may.

the credit rating is the make or break as i see it, too. the repercussions for that slipping are pretty catastrophic. i would imagine that that is business for 2012, and would be evoked by our still being stagnated with year-on growth below our projections, below 3 points, particularly if we are alone in those issues.

in the end, isn't the rating relative? if we keep our chin ahead of the pack we should be alright. a good republican showing in november, at least filibuster power, and some better economic news indicating we made it through the summer without dipping again, and things look up, too. that is the direction the country and economy is going, even as indicated by the stats on this gloom board.

depending on how you invest your time and money, there are far better long-term outlooks than short-term, it seems. that is, i hope.

<quote>
NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks took another late-day dive Tuesday after the government said it was starting criminal and civil investigations into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped almost 113 points. Its plunge came shortly before the close and minutes after Attorney General Eric Holder made the announcement. Stocks in energy companies and oil service providers tumbled on the news, and other stocks followed.

Holder would not say which companies or individuals might be under investigation. But investors quickly dumped stocks across the energy industry. BP PLC, which operated the rig that caused the spill, fell almost 15 percent. Anadarko Petroleum Corp., which has a stake in the rig that exploded, tumbled nearly 20 percent. Oil services company Halliburton Inc. fell almost 15 percent.

Analysts have said the oil spill has been among the many issues nagging at investors in recent weeks. Among the fears in the market is the potential economic hit from the spill. But Tuesday's announcement raised the possibility that oil companies might have to pay out huge amounts in fines, or see their operations hampered by a government investigation.

"Right now it's headline risk that's killing us in this market," said Ken Kamen, president of Mercadien Asset Management in Hamilton, N.J. He said the question marks that pop up when news breaks are making traders think it's safer to just retreat.

"When you just get over third-degree burns you don't go too near that stove. Last year is not too far out of peoples' minds," Kamen said, referring to the market's slide in 2008 and early 2009.

Yeah, you and I seem to be reading out of the same book.

Where we seem to differ is our confidence on keeping our chin out in front of the pack. I think with what this administration is doing, unless we have a total backlash and repeal of about every law an program passed since P-BO took power, we are not going to do it. But if we do, our chances improve dramatically.

yeah, we do differ there, fitz. i dont see the massive economic drag that some have associated with the current policies as anything that will pan out to more than political thrashing. what makes me confident about our chin ahead of the pack is that it appears to be ahead now through a variety of measures, and we have more going for us in the race. asian economies are turning flatter if not upside-down, as are some which are dragging on the EU.

considering that, if some of those variable could be added: balanced government, no solo double-dip, etc, we will be ok. it is hard for our economy to recover as sluggishly as the EU. more all-or-nothing than that.

i really doubt any political change will empower anyone to reverse the current political agenda. the probability of that is less than the chance of asian or euro economies bulling past the US in a global recovery. that's not good odds. it would require 'utter collapse' in mid 2012 to offer opposition politics the capital to affect that, as i see it, and that is not likely at all. this will only come about with a downgrade of our credit - and that will damage moody's credibility in equal measure to the US. republicans may have to turn to an agenda other than the economy to gain way.

Internally that makes sense:

Recovery is weak due to the huge debt overhang.

The stock market has outrun fundamentals.

But externally the US remains the best of the worst and that is why the stock market has gone too high. The Far East and EU are both in deep trouble making the US look comparatively good. Both have unfunded liabilities that are worse than the problems the US has with unfunded liabilities. The US markets could end up anywhere given the disconnect between internals and externals.

i see the far east trailing our economy because of the producer/consumer relationship we have. the only drag i can conceive is that of china on the dollar. what relationship do you see between the EU and the US which could drag us under. our economy is a lifeboat for sinking investment in the eurozone. if that does not pan out in our favor, shrinking investment from the EU comprises a fraction of total investment, which in turn is a small fraction of our economic base. they've now managed to underrate the euro, and that won't last for long enough to create persistent consequences to trade.

The EU zone seems to be headed for at least a currency split and more like a complete collapse.
</quote>
i find this to be far-fetched on either prognosis. i dont see any likelihood of a split in the next 2-3 years. i think that people hop on the bandwagon of panic without realizing that southern europe was invited into the euro to moderate its sky-rocketing value in the first place. in such a deflationary environment as this, it is no doubt that germany, a manufacturing power welcomed an opportunity to hype up weakness in the euro. italy, spain, portugal and greece, maybe ireland had their head in a vice with economies of their nature and a currency of so high a value obtained in so short a span. the current trend bodes well for them too. it is now more likely to hold together than before grecophobia kicked in.

and collapse how ? its funny to me: the arbitrary collapse predictions.

It's not that, well okay for ME, I'm not ignoring some of the positive signs, but often they are based on the fact they are being propped up by government borrowing and subsidies and rebates. Cash we don't have. It's just paying off one credit card with a different one, hoping we can keep one step ahead of our debtors.

For instance, home sales are still improving a little bit or not declining as fast because of the home buyer's credit. The instant this credit goes away, that will stop and quickly reverse course. This is due to the fact that the fundamental flaws that have caused the housing crisis have not been fixed, only refilled with borrowed/printed cash.

The job market isn't improving really because unemployment benefits keep getting extended. I have five friends collecting unemployment and would be totally fooked if it wasn't for the fact they're getting them. 3 would result probably in home mortgage defaults as well. But what this means is that when the money runs out for these benefits, currently supplied by borrowing as well, people will be diving for jobs like crazy, and you'll start seeing those people showing up in the data again. There is a vast pool of disenfranchised unemployed out there, just waiting for a sign they can get work again that even comes close to resembling what they used to get... and many of those jobs aren't there anymore are years from coming back.

We have bandages on sucking chest wounds. We can survive for now, but not for long if we don't start trying to fix the foundational injuries before we bleed out.

Why? Greece is on the verge of default, Dubai had to be bailed out by Abu Dhabi, Lithuania and Ireland have had to make extremely deep cuts to their budgets, and the world's governments have transferred the liabilities of their financial sectors to their own balance sheets.

And gold sits near an all-time high.
</quote>
Because you know as well as I do that the American economy is significantly larger than those of Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, and the UAE, and that gives us significantly more room to maneuver. I'm not saying we don't need to get our debt under control, only that some of the claims made about it are significantly overblown.
</quote>
The question is not whether or not America is going to default. The question is what is the probability of a default?

I do not believe that the US is going to default, but I believe that the market is underpricing the risk of a default. If the market thinks the odds are 5%, then I think it is higher, maybe 15%. That still means that I don't think the US will default but it is higher than most people believe.

The reason is simply because the math does not work. We already have a high amount of debt, we have accelerating liabilities in social security and medicare, and we are piling on more liabilities with this administration. Either taxes have to go up significantly and/or spending and entitlements have to be slashed drastically.

Having seen similar crises in other countries - and I mean developed countries, such as New Zealand, Canada and the UK - what must first happen is that the country must be pushed to the brink, and a realization and consensus that something must be done must come to the populace. America is nowhere near that point. If that consensus never comes, America will default on its debt.

I am optimistic that Americans will eventually come to that consensus, but I am less optimistic than I was a few years ago. People are becoming more, not less ideologically strident. That is a recipe for failure. I am not an American. I always assumed that I would eventually become an American citizen, but after watching the political dialogue over the past few years, I am now for the first time reconsidering nationalization. As a Canadian, I am not taxed on my worldwide income. Americans are. If a consensus is not reached, then bad things are going to happen in this country, and it may be best that I re-locate to the Caymans or Bermuda to avoid the financial chaos that could ensue. I don't think that will happen, but I am now considering that it may.

TOTALLY IDIOTIC SUPPOSITION. When are you guys going to wake up. If we did away with the FED, we would have no choice but to default. Otherwise, as long as we have the FED, we are home free.

i like medical analogies myself. the role that the government is playing in our economy at the moment is a bit like a pain reliever which is also indicated to reduce swelling. when your buddies on unemployment get their check, it is indeed a relief of the pains which come from losing your income. when the government issues the check, it is helping to reduce swelling which cuts circulation to a wound, increasing the chance for infection and slowing or damaging its ability to heal itself.

the bills and expenditures which unemployed are still managing to pay because of their benefits help to slow the deflationary action which unemployment creates. if the demand for goods and services is slashed due to unemployment seriously altering the average earnings in a city, that businesses in the city will respond by further reducing the labor force - either by layoffs or when they go belly-up. this will, in turn, further reduce the demand for goods. when homes and goods are repossesed, deflationary activity amounting to tens of thousands of dollars is realized. when businesses cant sell a widget or widget repair service for a dollar, and discount that service to 80 cents on that dollar, further deflation is realized in the market. less wealth is created at a given transaction and a cycle lending to further unemployment will take hold.

this is all happening anyhow. the government and agencies like the fed are the only on the planet which will try to shore that situation up. the business community will not hire your friends in an effort to get the economy going, but on the basis of demand for their services. what might be pain relief for your friends is an effort to protect forces driving down that demand, looking at the bigger picture. what else do you expect the government to do? how else would you expect the economy to recover from such a deep trough without this sort of help?

there's no way the government could fix the 'foundational injuries' sustained in the last couple years. that will have to come with time and some corrections in the private sector. it is even more realistic to look at the economy as a plant: it is more freeform. dependencies on employment and credit are two which our economy will shrink away from in this recovery, latching onto some other forces which will give these time to heal well into the expansion.

And when it comes to economics, there is some merit in thinking that perception is reality.

When enough of the people percieve that they are in trouble, they are going to act accordingly.

So very true!

As I have been pointing out to the uneducated on this board, Artificial GDP bought with excessive Federal expenditures does not a recovering economy make.

We have seen no signs of actual recovery, but we did come close in the past two months. Now it looks like it is all going to collapse. Hopefully not overnight.

When you see the actual Unemployment Claims starting to edge up like they are doing, you have reason to fear. Remember this, the only viable Unemployment numbers are the new claims from the states. The states do not make up an artificial labor force that is 15 million short of reality. The states do not conduct sham surveys. The states just count the number of new Claims and report that to the media and the DOL. The DOL has to report the numbers, or it would be accused of total dishonesty. They then say they have to adjust the numbers to make them more acceptable to the present administration. They do that and then say, "See how wonderful everything is getting?"

It is not getting wonderful. We are losing 100,000 more workers than we are generating.

UI Claims were 410,302 in the week ending May 29, an increase of 3,427 from the previous week. We are now falling again.

But only going by UI claims, you're NOT counting millions of people who are unemployed but not collecting or eligible for UI benefits. The state UI claims numbers show only 4,330,107 collecting benefits (ignoring the Federal numbers because those don't come from the states). What do you want to bet the Employment Situation gives a higher number by at least 10 million. Only in Neubarthland can one claim that Unemployment is really 30 million and the govt is lying when it says 15 million but the states are accurate in saying 4.3 million.

Well, first, they don't say that at all, which means " You are a satanic lying sack of shit. You have proven yourself to be the most pathological liar I have ever encountered in my life." And second, that doesn't account for all the times where the seasonally adjusted numbers are WORSE than the unadjusted numbers. In other words: " That is a damned lie and you are a damned liar. Why do pathological liars like you abound on this forum? Please get psychiatric help. Lie after lie after lie after lie from you and you think it is perfectly normal to carry on as you do."

It is not getting wonderful. We are losing 100,000 more workers than we are generating.

Speaking for myself as a libertarian what I see is that is that in terms of tangible benefits the unemployed are getting shortchanged on their costly and extorted bennies packages that mainly aid bureaucrats.

If you are going to take my taxes for it then I want all citizens to get food stamps and have a federal tax on groceries and maybe restaurant meals paid by people not buying on food stamps.

If you are homeless and the mobile homes and condos are not selling anyhow then make them into temporary section 8 housing and get that inventory off the market.

The US government can buy used clothing that would otherwise be sold in the 3rd world and make it available cheap or free to those in need.

I'm already paying for legal services for the poor so why not streamline and broaden bankruptcy proceedings for those out of work?

Why am I paying high for services that deliver little or nothing to those who need those services? The administrative costs of all those services in cash means that the poor get stiffed, the taxpayers get stiffed and only the politicians profit. Why not deliver those services in kind so we can avoid as much of that mess as possible?

Jobless Recovery: Stocks Tumble on "Punk" Private Sector Hiring

On the surface, Friday's jobs report doesn't look so bad: Non-farm payrolls rose by 430,000 in May, the second straight month of solid gains, the unemployment rate fell to 9.7%, and the averages for hours worked and hourly earnings beat expectations.
But it's hard to put lipstick on this pig, which helped send stocks sharply lower Friday morning:

* The payroll gain was about 100,000 jobs below consensus, far below the "whisper numbers" of as high as 800,000, and the tally for March and April was revised down.
* A big reason the unemployment rate came down is the labor force shrank by 325,000, a sign of Americans discouraged by their prospects for finding work.
* Over 45% of unemployed Americans have been out of work 6 months or longer and the average duration of unemployment hit a new record of 34.4 weeks.
* At 411,000, temporary hiring of census workers accounted for the vast majority of jobs created last month while private sector payrolls rose by a paltry 41,000.
"The only part that mattered within the May payroll number was the 41,000 job add (sic) in the private sector," writes Miller Tabak equity strategist Peter Boockvar. "Bottom line, private sector hiring remains punk."

I have said it over and over and I will repeat it again. This recovery is going to be choppy because it is unlike any recovery we have seen since the Depression. This is not a demand/inventory correction. This is a balance sheet/excessive credit recession. We had an excessive build-up of credit, inflating asset values, and it has collapsed. This looks very new to Americans but has occurred something like 70 times in other countries over the past half century or so. And when it happens, the playbook is pretty much the same. There are several years of substandard growth and unemployment stays high. If anything else were to happen in this recovery, I would be shocked.

And financial markets are going to go a whole lot of nowhere for some time IMHO.

The last recession was a milder form of this one because it was induced by the collapse of the technology bubble. Job recovery after the last recession was the weakest since the Depression. Here are the NFPs for 2002 and 2003.

2002 -132 -147 -24 -85 -7 45 -97 -16 -55 126 8 -156
2003 83 -158 -212 -49 -6 -2 25 -42 103 203 18 124

See how they bounce up and down? That is what is going to happen this time as well.

As for dissing Keynes, there is no doubt that had the government not stepped in to backstop the financial markets, then we would have had a repeat of the Great Depression. Oh, and there have been more tax cuts than spending on government programs in the stimulus to date. I guess tax cuts don't work!

Are you in sales? You have the same answer for every scenario:

Market was up - It was because of the stimulus. It worked. The feds "backstopped" the markets.
Market goes down - it was because of normal gyrations of the market. If the feds didn't "backstop" the markets it would have been far worse.

Unemployment goes down - the stimulus worked. Thankfully the Feds backstopped the markets or we'd be in a Depression now.
Unemployment goes up - that's just normal gyrations. Imagine how bad it would have been if the Feds hadn't "backstopped" the markets.

Wash, Rinse, and Repeat for every situation.......

Market goes down - it was because of normal gyrations of the market. If the feds didn't "backstop" the markets it would have been far worse.

Unemployment goes down - the stimulus worked. Thankfully the Feds backstopped the markets or we'd be in a Depression now.
Unemployment goes up - that's just normal gyrations. Imagine how bad it would have been if the Feds hadn't "backstopped" the markets.

Wash, Rinse, and Repeat for every situation.......

People think "tax cut=conservative=non-keynsian."
It isn't true.
Tax cuts are an amorphous thng. What Conservatives want, and what Kennedy, Reagan,and Bush showed, was that targeted tax cuts make the difference.
If you cut taxes on cigarettes, that isn't stimulative to the economy. A few more packs will be sold is all.
If you cut taxes at the margin (adn that's important) then you increase the incentive to work harder and produce. It is the next dollar of income that we are worried about.
Handing out cash for clunkers, cash for first time home buyers, cash for calkers etc etc is not a tax cut. It is a giveaway and bribe with our own money.

Obama and his Keynesian Economic team have presided over the largest expansion of government in history. They are spending over $5 BILLON per day that we do not have. Do you deny that Geithner is a Keynesian? Summers? Paulson? Romer? Barnes? Higgenbottom? KEYNESIANS ALL!!!

you will find that debt crises are post-keynesian phenomenon. we had a decidedly keynesian era in the US, as did several other world economies. this is not it. it was not characterized by the sort of debt we've been encumbered with since reaganomics, for better or worse.

our debt has little or nothing to do with keynesianism. perhaps about $2 trillion or so in stimulus could be so attributed, but given other aspects of our policies now, and for the last 30 years, i'd chalk the stimulus up to common sense. a policy shift to back to keynesian or neo-keynesian practices would take more than a recovery phase to diagnose.

your attribution only indicates you've got no clue what you're talking about.

Government spent money during a recession, so of course it's 'keynesianism'.

Its not a deflection. Your point of reference for "Keynesianism" was the deficit. Well, Reagan cut taxes and created a large deficit. The biggest part of the Obama stimulus thus far has been tax cuts. Ergo, by your logic, Reagan's a Keynsian. So was W.

When Obama took office, the cyclical fiscal balance was a $1.2 trillion deficit. During the remaining part of the fiscal year, he added another $100 billion, almost all of that was tax cuts and extensions of social programs. Most of the deficit and debt thus far has nothing to do with Obama. Going forward, Obama owns it. He wanted to be President, so he has to deal with it. But the fiscal structure of the federal government was well in place long before he came into office.

The most effective part of "Keynesianism" has been backstopping the financial system, which mainly occurred under Bush. And there is zero, zip, nada doubt in my mind that what Bush did prevented a repeat of the Great Depression. No doubt that this has created massive imbalances for which we will have to pay, but we were on the verge of a massive run on money markets that probably would have destroyed the financial markets and collapsed the economy.

As for Keynes rolling in his grave, Keynes did not advocate that governments run deficits year after year, which is what Reagan, Bush II and Obama are doing. (Clinton balanced the budget and Bush I gets credit for laying the groundwork.) But Keynes argued that the government should have backstopped the banking system during the Great Depression, so there is no doubt he would have supported what Bush and Obama did.

i give you that, but keynes has been tumbling in his grave since he was put in it.

it is hard to associate economists with schools of thought, economists with jobs who act on what they think are even harder. you end up with 'geitnerist' after a tenure in government, some lecturing and a few books.

i would say that wanting to be keynesian wont make you so, granted the way the US is set up and the momentum behind the last guy's policies. we will take the best bits from these playbooks and put them to work, history has shown, and we should. this is not 'econ 340: perspectives of applied macroeconomics in distressed economies', this is the real deal.

there's some realities keynes hadn't accounted for in his time, however, i couldnt write off his resolutions to sick economies. compared to modern hayekian/chicago school, moneterist, austrian, or whatever proposals, keynesianism has a track-record for bringing jobs back online sooner, placing rebounds on firmer ground. i just dont think it held up to the stagflationary factors in the 70s, which stripped it from its acclaim.

there are such factors at play now, and which go after demand, rather than supply. what school of economic thought would you put up on the chopping block for this recovery?

you got obama's cell #?

Whne you say "backstop the banking system" do you mean to include the bailouts of AIG, Goldman, GM, adn Chrysler (i'm forgetting some I know)? Because those were not helpful in stemming the Great Depression.
I was fine with "backstopping" the banks, meaning guaranteeing they would lend to each otehr, which had ceased. I was not fine with everyone piling on to get theirs.
That is where Obama comes in. Most of the increased spending has been on transfer payments. That isn't helpful.
Reagan's cuts were different in that they added to economic growth. If it had not been for the Democratic congress, the deficit would have all but disappeared, especially interms of GDP. But Congress pushed more and more money as revenues increased.

I think bailing out GM was completely unnecessary. But as much as I hate to say it, investing in AIG was probably the most critical part along with backstopping the money markets. The Lehman collapse almost took down everything. AIG was much, much more important.

I hate, hate, hate bailouts because they create enormous moral hazard. Ideally, all institutions should be allowed to fail. But I'm pragmatic, and from where I sit, the results would have been catastrophic had we not. The government should have gotten much better terms, though.

no such. i did take care to say 'proposals'. comprehensive application of any theory may be asking too much. there are many untested theories out there, but keynes' has a track-record. a track record with some negative side-effects, too, i'd add, but one which precluded post-keynesian jobless recoveries and debt-dependency.

this is why i advocate a smorgasbord approach when shit hits the fan, picking medicines indicated for the differing symptoms in the economy. in a healthy expansion, the antagon school of economics dictates that all these inputs are gently withdrawn, leaving the top to spin on its own.

i've got some ideas as to what austrian solutions to our current situation or to the recession itself might be, but they're a bit pejorative.

THE universe about 1950 to 1980. shifting away from the demand model fundamental to keynesianism, and you get the jobless recovery instead of jobs and no/slow recovery.

like the 70s, other factors are at play, particularly technology, but it is a track-record with plausible causality to the policy's focus on bolstering demand.

go figure: we are in a demand-stricken state scratching our heads about where the jobs are at.

But then you spoke of 'track records'. How can a mere proposal have a track record if it's never been applied?

The Austrians are pretty well recognized as having the best grasp of the effect of money supply. They're the ones who define inflation properly, as increases in the money supply being the CAUSE of inflation. Any economist worth his or her salt recognizes that.

Then why did Hayek win the Nobel Memorial for demonstrating that the inflation of the early 1920s caused the deflation of the early 1930s?

doesn't that depend on the definition of the money supply being used in the market to contract business? And does not the operative money supply shift with the length of the cycle to ever more derived and leveraged forms of money as the expansion continues?

no such. i did take care to say 'proposals'. comprehensive application of any theory may be asking too much. there are many untested theories out there, but keynes' has a track-record. a track record with some negative side-effects, too, i'd add, but one which precluded post-keynesian jobless recoveries and debt-dependency.

this is why i advocate a smorgasbord approach when shit hits the fan, picking medicines indicated for the differing symptoms in the economy. in a healthy expansion, the antagon school of economics dictates that all these inputs are gently withdrawn, leaving the top to spin on its own.

it is simply not the case that austrian school proposals on the money supply are regarded as the 'best grasp'. not in the US; where are you talking about. the world is more endeared to m. friedman and hayek than any austrian scholar with regard to monetary policy.

the relationship between increased money supply and inflation was understood long before the austrian school ever existed, long before fractional reserve. sometimes austrian arguments are made ala armchair quarterback and in a way which lends to their agenda. the austrian analysis of the great depression is a key example of this.

exploring the austrians and their assessment of the great depression sheds light on why their methods have been cast aside, save for consideration of moderate application of its components. austrian criticisms make attributions which fail to consider other understood factors in economics, rather focusing on those which support their platform. this platform, rather than incorporating contemporary observations from the econ community, juxtaposes its position to it. in essence, it is juxtaposed to modern economics altogether.

it isn't a fear of trying anything new, rather, a distaste for abandoning what works for a compilation of proposals which have been shown not to enable an economy to work in the benefit of a society.

what about austrian school economics makes you feel that there is much to offer from a comprehensive adaptation of their proposals? have you considered that the mystery which you recognize regarding government's lack of affection for austrian school econ might have something to do with negative assessments of the implications of their policies?

Whne you say "backstop the banking system" do you mean to include the bailouts of AIG, Goldman, GM, adn Chrysler (i'm forgetting some I know)? Because those were not helpful in stemming the Great Depression.
I was fine with "backstopping" the banks, meaning guaranteeing they would lend to each otehr, which had ceased. I was not fine with everyone piling on to get theirs.
That is where Obama comes in. Most of the increased spending has been on transfer payments. That isn't helpful.
Reagan's cuts were different in that they added to economic growth. If it had not been for the Democratic congress, the deficit would have all but disappeared, especially interms of GDP. But Congress pushed more and more money as revenues increased.
</quote>
I think bailing out GM was completely unnecessary. But as much as I hate to say it, investing in AIG was probably the most critical part along with backstopping the money markets. The Lehman collapse almost took down everything. AIG was much, much more important.

I hate, hate, hate bailouts because they create enormous moral hazard. Ideally, all institutions should be allowed to fail. But I'm pragmatic, and from where I sit, the results would have been catastrophic had we not. The government should have gotten much better terms, though.
</quote>
Well, people were saying the same thing about CIT Group. And they filed for bankruptcy and everything was orderly.
The bailouts created a huge moral hazard. We will see the ill effects of them for years. If AIG had really gone down we would have seen ill effects for 6 months.
This government has pumped all the money they can and engineered all the programs they can and the result is a lingering recession.
It was entirely predictable as Japan embarked on exactly the same course with exactly the same results.

I completely disagree. AIG should never existed as is in the first place, but had AIG not been nationalized, then it would have been Lehman many times over.

During the Lehman crisis, companies could not access cash. Companies that said they had cash on the balance sheet were not sure if they had it anymore. Real companies, not just financial ones. Many thought their cash balances may have gone up in smoke. Goldman was days from falling. Morgan Stanley was effectively insolvent and was telling hedge funds they couldn't access their cash, even though the funds had every right to withdraw their money. AIG failing would have meant a massive withdrawal of liquidity from the capital markets and the real economy unlike anything we have ever seen before. AIG sold credit insurance to financial institutions, companies and those underwriting structured products. Because AIG used its AAA balance sheet to guarantee those products, literally trillions of dollars of derivatives needed little collateral to back up the structures. Had AIG not been able to honor those contracts, then massive capital calls for collateral would have occurred, withdrawing staggering amounts of liquidity from the financial system, making the American banking system effectively insolvent.

The Fed also had an alphabet soup of programs to take assets off the balance sheets of banks. Some worked, some didn't. The unintended consequences have yet to be seen in a big way, but by transferring assets to the balance sheets of the US government, they effectively reliquified the financial system, though almost certainly damaging the value of the US dollar in the process. There were no good options.

What I find strange is that AIG got out of the mortgage CDS business in 2005 because of excessive risk yet so far as I can tell they spent almost none of their premium incomes on hedging their risk.

More Economic Reality. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aa0cI64Gx.4E&amp;pos=15">U.S.’s $13 Trillion Debt Poised to Overtake GDP:</a>

<quote>
By Garfield Reynolds and Wes Goodman

June 4 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama is poised to increase the U.S. debt to a level that exceeds the value of the nation’s annual economic output, a step toward what Bill Gross called a “debt super cycle.”

The CHART OF THE DAY tracks U.S. gross domestic product and the government’s total debt, which rose past $13 trillion for the first time this month. The amount owed will surpass GDP in 2012, based on forecasts by the International Monetary Fund. The lower panel shows U.S. annual GDP growth as tracked by the IMF, which projects the world’s largest economy to expand at a slower pace than the 3.2 percent average during the past five decades.

“Over the long term, interest rates on government debt will likely have to rise to attract investors,” said Hiroki Shimazu, a market economist in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., a unit of Japan’s third-largest publicly traded bank. “That will be a big burden on the government and the people.”

Gross, who runs the world’s largest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, California, said in his June outlook report that “the debt super cycle trend” suggests U.S. economic growth won’t be enough to support the borrowings “if real interest rates were ever to go up instead of down.”

Stocks fell on Monday in a late-day selloff that took the Dow Jones Industrial Average below its lows of the May 6 "flash crash."

The Dow ended down 115.48 points, or 1.2%, at a seven-month low of 9816.49 and below 9869.62, its low-point of the May 6 slide. That day, buyers rushed into the market at that level, helping pare a 1,000-point drop to a decline of 347.80 points.

But on Monday, no such buying appeared. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2%. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index slid 1.4%.

"Global tensions are at a pinnacle," said Mike Daly, gold specialist at PFGBest in Chicago. That has prompted investors to move money into "tangible, safer assets."'

As part of that move, gold soared, ending with its biggest one-day gain in almost four months. Gold also began the day quietly. But at around 10 a.m., a sudden wave of buying drove the metal up by 2% within an hour, pushing it toward record Comex highs reached in mid-May.

ASHINGTON (AP) -- The mortgage crisis is dragging on the economic recovery as more homeowners fall behind on their payments.

Analysts expect improvement soon, but the number of homeowners in default or at risk of foreclosure will have a lingering effect on the broader economy.

More than 10 percent of homeowners with a mortgage had missed at least one payment in the January-March period, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday. That's a record high and up from 9.1 percent a year ago.

Existing Home Sales Tumble Unexpectedly in May

<quote>
Sales of previously owned homes fell unexpectedly in May as delays in processing mortgage applications hampered the closing of contracts benefiting from a popular homebuyer tax credit, an industry group said on Tuesday.

AP

The National Association of Realtors said sales fell 2.2 percent month over month to an annual rate of 5.66 million units from an upwardly revised 5.79 million-unit pace in April.

Analysts polled by Reuters expected May sales to rise 5.5 percent to a 6.12 million-unit pace from the previously reported 5.77 million units in April. Sales were up 19.2 percent compared to May last year.

Sales were expected to rise as transactions for existing homes are measured at contract closing.

Although the tax credit for home buyers expired in April, qualified home owners have until June 30 to close contracts.

There hasn't been much of a rebound in housing.

The bad news just keeps coming. Even Tax Cheater Timothy Geithner admits the economy is in the shitter and likely to get worse before it gets better.

<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.7a5d51a78d5d2cd026aaf0637654beb9.c61&amp;show_article=1">US economy still in 'difficult period': Geithner</a>

<quote>
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday said the US economy was "still going through an incredibly difficult period," as he warned the impact of the crisis would be "lasting."

"Millions of Americans are still looking for work and are suffering from the damage of a deep recession. The impact of this crisis will be lasting," he said in prepared testimony to Congress.

<quote>
Sales of new homes dropped a record 32.7 percent in May to the lowest level in at least four decades as the boost from a popular tax credit faded, adding to worries of a slowing economic recovery.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday single-family home sales tumbled to a 300,000 unit annual rate, the lowest level since the series started in 1963.

The expiry of the tax incentive has also resulted in a decline in new home construction and demand for home loans applications for loans to buy homes fell last week, staying near 13-year lows.

Last month's weak sales pace saw the supply of homes available for sale jumping a record 46.6 percent to 8.5 months' worth, the highest in nearly a year, from 5.8 months' worth in April. However, the number of new homes on the market dipped 0.5 percent to 213,000 units, the lowest since November 1970.

The median sale price for a new home fell 1 percent in May from April to $200,900. In the 12 months to May, prices fell 9.6 percent, the largest decline since July 200

Why would anyone buy a new home today, when it will be cheaper in the future? Deflation....it's a bitch.

Depends on your time frame. The next few years could be rough but there are parts of the real estate market that are staggeringly cheap.

Personally, I'm hoping for another leg down and the banks have to puke out another round of properties.

Further, since I live in the Florida Panhandle, I'm hoping the oil slick slams onto our beaches because I'm looking at beachfront property and I want to see it collapse!

Don't know if it is still true but I hear it still is: 25% discount for cash on repos. Flippers can drop the fair market value by 10%/qtr for a 13% annualized profit. With 90% leverage and 6% for 10 year money my guess is around 62.5% return after debt service. Just don't get greedy when the returns go below 50% in a given real estate market pull in your horns because that is the point when that market is ready to collapse back to 1988 prices.

At best Toro, you will see two to three percent more selling of beach front properties. Most will know that gushers, even underwater do not last for ever. Nature can quickly heal the damage from the oil. I remember as a ten year old living north of Manzanillo where my father and I used to body surf on pristine beaches every day. The only footprint on the white sand beaches would be ours from the day or days before. One day we went to our favorite beach, Olas Altas (High Waves), and it was covered with an oil slick that had washed up at high tide. About ten feet of sand for miles up and down the coast was stained black by a layer that was about one half to a third of an inch thick. It stained the sand for several days after that. It was mostly gone except for an occasional tar ball buried in the sand after four or five days. Nature does clean itself up.

As regards appreciation of property, that always comes with inflation. Unfortunately we might see some Deflation over the coming months.

Gov't just revised downward GDP growth expectations. Market ready to tank, no one has any confidence in it (I posted this in the "Market bottom" thread some time ago).
No, it's double dip time. ANy growth we've seen is partially from the expectation of higher taxes in January.

I'm looking at a beachfront piece on the ocean for sale that has fallen by 62.5% from the peak based on the asking price. The broker says they'll go lower to a 67.5% decline. But I still think it will eventually go for 75%-80% when the bank repos it. So I'm just waiting.

If you are bullish, then by all means, feel free to get fully invested in stocks. In fact, you should buy on margin! Good luck!

There are at least three major investing strategies that have to be discredited before a true bottom is hit:

Efficient market, buy and hold, will die after a year or two of bouncing on the bottom or however long it takes to get the buy and hold crowd to go into other investments.

Momentum investing, the trend is your friend, will be destroyed by short oscillations in market values that trigger stop losses.

The one criterion schools of price, growth or dividends such as the beat the Dow system are falling one by one as they get gamed by CFOs.

Until tangible value rules again the market is is deep trouble.
