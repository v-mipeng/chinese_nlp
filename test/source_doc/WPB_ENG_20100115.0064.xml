WASHINGTON _ Organized in honor of what would have been Elvis Presley's 75th
birthday this month _ and the first of several Elvis-themed exhibitions opening
at area museums this year _ the National Portrait Gallery's "One Life: Echoes of
Elvis" is a little party of a show.
</P>
<P>
It's meant to be fun, in other words. That's according to curator Warren Perry,
who supplements the one-room show's seven portraits of Elvis with display cases
featuring Elvis-themed books, memorabilia, a handmade scrapbook put together
after his death by an anonymous fan and photographs of Graceland by artist
William Eggleston.
</P>
<P>
This is not a show for anyone wondering, "Now about those teen-age girls ... "
</P>
<P>
It does, however, get at the concept of Elvis as something larger than life. Two
of the works in the show are by Howard Finster, the late folk artist known for
his pictures of angels and Coca-Cola bottles. In fact, Finster's 1990 portrait
"Elvis at Three" depicts the singer, who died in 1977, with white wings. Based
on a famous photograph, the artist's other contribution to the show, the 1991
"Elvis in Army Uniform," is almost as iconic a silhouette as a Coke bottle. Its
depiction of Elvis reveals not the man, but a distinctly American ideal.
</P>
<P>
"Elvis, the Artist, and Pink Cadillac" (1988) by folk artist Donald Paterson
plays with that same theme, setting Elvis and his signature car against a
cityscape featuring a version of the American flag and an apple tree. The
closest thing to the dark side of Elvis? Red Grooms' cartoonish 1987 lithograph,
in which the gold-lame-suited performer _ posing in front of Graceland with
guitar and Caddy, naturally _ sports a lip curl that is almost as sinister as it
is sexy.
</P>
<P>
The show makes one point exceptionally well. "You don't need to be an Elvis
fan," says Perry, "to have an Elvis connection." There's a certain intimacy to
these portraits of a man whom, for the most part, the artists never met. (Note
also that no one ever calls him anything but "Elvis.") And why is that? "I can't
say exactly," says Perry, adding that the mystery of our enduring fascination
with Elvis is one of many topics that will be addressed in a March symposium on
Elvis (see below).
</P>
<P>
One thing not up for discussion: the pop-cultural phenomenon of the black-velvet
Elvis. Although there are no Elvis-on-velvet paintings in the show _ a glaring
oversight, perhaps _ Perry (who himself owns two) is well aware of their appeal,
chalking it up to the fact that, to many of us, Elvis is forever frozen, like a
bug in amber, in the kitsch of the 1970s. Somehow that combination of velvet and
Elvis _ "like peanut butter and bananas," Perry says _ just stuck in our minds.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Wolfe Cowan's oil-on-canvas portrait, based on 1969 sketches from the
singer's only actual portrait sitting, wraps up this small show best. Its Elvis
is both human, clad in blue jeans with a heart-shaped key chain dangling from
the pocket, and beatified. A cathedral of pinkish clouds frames its almost
Christlike subject _ and Graceland in the distance.
</P>
<P>
Cowan, as curator Perry notes, is the world's most prolific painter of heads of
state, so it makes sense that the King chose to sit for him.
