<TEXT>
<P>
A plea hearing for retired NBA star Jayson Williams in the 2002 shooting death
of a driver was indefinitely delayed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Superior Court Judge Edward M. Coleman did not give a reason as he
indefinitely delayed the hearing, in which Williams was expected to plead guilty
to aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
Williams has already been convicted, in 2004, of trying to cover up the shooting
death of Costas Christofi, his hired driver, at his New Jersey home in 2002.
</P>
<P>
He was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter charges but the jury could not reach
a verdict on a reckless manslaughter count and Williams faced a retrial on that
charge.
