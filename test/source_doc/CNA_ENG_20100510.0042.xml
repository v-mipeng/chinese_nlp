Zhou Bingde, a niece of the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai said in Taipei
Monday that her uncle attached great importance to reconciliation between the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT) before he died in January
1976.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Bingde said that shortly before he died, her uncle wrote the Chinese
character "tuo" -- meaning entrusting or committing to -- four times as an
expression of his wishes for cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
"My uncle's repeated writing of the word 'tuo' reflected his keen expectation of
the eventual peaceful unification of China and Taiwan, " said Zhou, a public
relations executive with the Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Association in
China, at a conference called the Whampoa Forum.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Bingde, who authored the book "My Uncle Zhou Enlai, " spoke of her uncle's
connection to the Whampoa Military Academy and late Republic of China President
Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
She said Chiang was the commandant of the Nationalist Party of China Army
Officer Academy, commonly known as the Whampoa Military Academy, in Guangzhou in
the 1920s while her uncle served as director of the academy's Political
Department.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Enlai, she said, accompanied the Whampoa cadets on a military operation in
the Guizhou area conducted by the KMT forces in 1925 led by Chiang Kai-shek --
later known as the Second Eastern Expedition.
</P>
<P>
He also fought shoulder to shoulder with Whampoa cadets in the Northern
Expedition and the Second Sino-Japanese War, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Whampoa Forum opened in Taipei Monday with chairman Hsu Li-nung delivering
an opening speech.  Hsu formerly served as president of the Army Academy, the
Taiwanese version of the Whampoa Military Academy.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said the purpose of the forum was to uphold Sun Yat-sen's principles,
galvanize the Whampoa spirit and bolster peace across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the forum, honorary KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said the
prerequisite for striking a peace accord across the Taiwan Strait is building a
military trust mechanism between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Since it is still too early for the two sides to touch on sensitive political
and military issues, he suggested the two sides start engaging with each other
in academic and cultural milieus.
</P>
<P>
"Estrangement and misunderstanding decrease when interaction increases, " he
said, adding that only by increasing exchanges can the two sides develop true
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Among those who traveled from around the world to attend the forum included Zuo
Taibei, daughter of Zuo Quan, a general leading China's forces in fighting the
Japanese and formerly a deputy chief of staff of communist China's forces.
</P>
<P>
Also in attendance was Hsieh Chi-min, son of Kuomintang General Hsieh Chin-yuan,
who led 800 Chinese soldiers against superior Japanese forces and perished
alongside his men after putting up stiff resistance for two months.
