What's next after Obama's Olympic Humiliation?
</headline>
<post author="CrusaderFrank" datetime="2009-10-02T14:01:00" id="p1">
Though I loath Obama and everything he stands for, I cringed when he embarrassed himself by flying to Denmark to beg them for the Olympics. It's a major, MAJOR embarrassment for America as a nation to have our President both get personally involved in a matter so trivial and then to get bitch slapped by nobodies.

What's a Community Organizer to do?

You are quite right this is an incredible embarrassment for the Obama White House.

From here, you will see a weekend news cycle of downplaying the rebuke by the Olympics Committee, followed by an increasingly chaotic health care debate, and perhaps another surprise from Iran.

Perhaps the greatest loser of this affair has been the mainstream media - once again showing its blatant in-the-tank attitude toward Obama. The media was stunned at Obama's Olympics failure - they were running stories of how Michelle "stole the show" and how impressive was the President's plea to the committee, while at almost the same time, the committee was voting down Chicago in the first round.

Check out the CNN guy freaking out after the announcement...LOL

Chicago is OUT? Chicago is OUT? Bloody brilliant!

So conservative pundits are rejoicing and the Drudge Report is blaring the headline: "THE EGO HAS LANDED WORLD REJECTS OBAMA: CHICAGO OUT IN FIRST ROUND." (talk about rampant exageration there).

[quote]
It's an aggressive posture. But also, potentially, a risky one, not just because polling data showed that a vast majority of the country wanted America to host the games (though some were skeptical of the need for Obama to make a personal pitch). But also because it continues to produce the specter of conservatives bludgeoning the reputation of America's "second city."

.....Taken as a whole, however, the steady stream of Republican attacks raise as many questions about the GOP's strategy as they do about the president's. For starters: is it smart politics to argue that a major American city is unfit to host the Olympic games ? More than one Democratic strategist has pointed out that, if Democrats had attacked George W. Bush for pushing Dallas as an Olympics host, they would immediately have been branded as unpatriotic.

The Right Wing Is Against the Olympics? Oy Vey!
When President Barack Obama decided to go to Denmark, he hoped to win international support Friday for the U.S. bid for the 2016 Olympics to be in Chicago. The moment he signed on, however, he also generated <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/20091001/pl_mcclatchy/3324078">a storm of criticism from the right at home.</a>

This is amazing, I find myself in a position of actually defending Obama <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>
If anyone had actually listened to the news reports (yes even on Fox) it was the Chicago presentation team that failed miserably. The IOC said Obama's separate presentation was the only high point for Chicago, which didn't stand a chance, once again, due to the Chicago presentation.

The corruption of the media is happening right before our very eyes and they wonder why we don't trust them? lol....

With this latest gaffe, Obama has shown himself to be a rank amateur with ZERO experience at anything but feeding at the public trough. He has no idea of power and prestige his office wields and consequently makes horrid decisions about when and where to wield that power. He makes inane comments about subjects that the POTUS should never even dignify. He is shockingly inept and a disgrace to the office. He really needs Clinton to coach him......

If he had NOT gone, there would be criticism that he didn't try hard enough to bring the Olympics here and create all those jobs.

I knew from the start that his decision to go would also be criticised, so I was hoping he'd change his mind.

Damned if he does, damned if he doesn't. Same ol' same ol.

If Chicago had won the venue, there would be non-stop criticism of Chicago itself, and Obama's ties to the city. I can see all the blogspots now berating everything he did as a resident, a community organizer and as a Senator from Illinois. You people would dig up every nose pick, every word he ever uttered, try to tie him to Chicago corruption and allege that he BRIBED the Olympic Committee. You would soon destroy the image of Chicago and make it so that people would not want to attend the games in such an awful city. All because you so hate Barack Obama.

Let's see.......Bush was at fault for 9/11 and Obama doesn't get the blame for this. Bush had less then 8 months to take control of the government and he gets the blame. Obama has more time and he still isn't on the right track.

Besides, the press has been telling us how wonderful Obama is. I thought everyone loved his ass.

Seems all of that apologizing should have impressed somebody. But when you cut down the country like Obama constantly does I guess the world must feel we really suck.

I also thought he was supposed to be a miracle worker.

Well I guess not.

All of those people in Chicago were stunned that Obama didn't deliver.

Get used to it people.

The corruption of the media is happening right before our very eyes and they wonder why we don't trust them? lol....

With this latest gaffe, Obama has shown himself to be a rank amateur with ZERO experience at anything but feeding at the public trough. He has no idea of power and prestige his office wields and consequently makes horrid decisions about when and where to wield that power. He makes inane comments about subjects that the POTUS should never even dignify. He is shockingly inept and a disgrace to the office. He really needs Clinton to coach him......

You are quite right this is an incredible embarrassment for the Obama White House.

From here, you will see a weekend news cycle of downplaying the rebuke by the Olympics Committee, followed by an increasingly chaotic health care debate, and perhaps another surprise from Iran.

Perhaps the greatest loser of this affair has been the mainstream media - once again showing its blatant in-the-tank attitude toward Obama. The media was stunned at Obama's Olympics failure - they were running stories of how Michelle "stole the show" and how impressive was the President's plea to the committee, while at almost the same time, the committee was voting down Chicago in the first round.

Check out the CNN guy freaking out after the announcement...LOL

Chicago is OUT? Chicago is OUT? Bloody brilliant!

I'm not sure I agree with you on this.

One of the major reasons many news agencies cite for London winning the 2012 Olympics was Tony Blair personally showing up for the final voting process and lobbying some of the delegates. Chirac's remoteness and some of his silly remarks are also considered to have hindered the Paris bid. I'm sure Obama took these issues into account.

One wonders whether Obama was relying on being able to show up and sway the vote based purely on his speech and personal charisma, or whether he really got involved. Either way, it's a major blunder for him to get so visibly involved when there was, it appears, minimal support for the Chicago bid in the first place. His people should have known this - no politician can afford to fight battles that are already lost.

Either way, the US has had 2 relatively recent Olympics, whereas South America has had none.

Major embarrassment for America as a nation? If true, America needs thicker skin.

But it is certainly an embarrassment for Obama.

So conservative pundits are rejoicing and the Drudge Report is blaring the headline: "THE EGO HAS LANDED WORLD REJECTS OBAMA: CHICAGO OUT IN FIRST ROUND." (talk about rampant exageration there).

<quote>
It's an aggressive posture. But also, potentially, a risky one, not just because polling data showed that a vast majority of the country wanted America to host the games (though some were skeptical of the need for Obama to make a personal pitch). But also because it continues to produce the specter of conservatives bludgeoning the reputation of America's "second city."

.....Taken as a whole, however, the steady stream of Republican attacks raise as many questions about the GOP's strategy as they do about the president's. For starters: is it smart politics to argue that a major American city is unfit to host the Olympic games ? More than one Democratic strategist has pointed out that, if Democrats had attacked George W. Bush for pushing Dallas as an Olympics host, they would immediately have been branded as unpatriotic.

(adding that apparently Chicago isn't corrupt enough...as we all saw with Salt Lake City...a little palm grease goes a long way with the IOC)

Hey, ASSHOLE -- Here's the text of his speech, only two paragraphs of which did he talk about HIS Chicago roots.

Full Text of Obama Olympics Speech

Thank you, everybody. Thank you. It is true that I always wanted to fence and I thought that would be cool. So I might get a couple tips from you guys.

Now you see one of the reasons that I love Chicago so much. It's the city where I met the woman I love.

Sixteen days away -- we're just 16 days away from the deciding vote on which world city will host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

So let's get right down to business here: The United States is eager to welcome the world to our shores. This nation would be honored to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and to serve as host to thousands of athletes and millions of visitors from around the world. And within this great country of ours, there is no better city than that than Chicago, Illinois.

Now, I may live in Washington these days. I love Washington, D.C. And our house here is a little bigger than the one we got in Chicago. (Laughter.) But I've called Chicago home for nearly 25 years. It's a city of broad shoulders and big hearts and bold dreams; a city of legendary sports figures, legendary sports venues, and legendary sports fans; a city like America itself, where the world -- the world's races and religions and nationalities come together and reach for the dream that brought them here.

In Chicago, old and new exist in harmony. It's a city rooted in an industrial past that laid this nation's railroads, forged this nation's steel, rebuilt itself after a great fire, and reversed the course of a mighty river. And it's also a city of bustle and gleaming promise that Mayor Daley has pledged to make the greenest in America. And that's why I think that one of the most exciting parts of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is that all of the plans being made in Chicago exist within minutes of the city center; easily accessible to commerce and culture, parkland and water -- because we don't want these venues to be far-flung, all over the place. We want to host these Games where we live and work and play.

We want them in the heart of our proud city -- the city that opened the way westward in the 19th century, that showed the way skyward in the 20th century, and that is leading the way forward in the 21st century. So Chicago is ready. The American people are ready. We want these Games. We want them.

The Olympic and Paralympic Games, they hold a special place in our psyche. They lift us up. They bind us together. They're the sources of fleeting moments -- instants, really -- that have become permanently seared in our collective memories: The humble victory of Jesse Owens. The perfection of Nadia and Mary Lou. Michael Johnson's astonishment at his own feat. Derek Redmond and Kerri Strug bravely making it through with a little help. Jean Driscoll racing her wheelchair to gold after gold, be it over 100 meters or 26.2 miles. Moments of euphoria after years of hard work, and moments when the human spirit triumphed over injury that should have been impossible to overcome. Moments of a team's shared glory, and moments of lonely disappointment despite one's best efforts. Countless moments we live and relive again and again, silently and subconsciously, nodding yes, we do believe in miracles.

We find ourselves riveted by the Games. Because even as we cheer, even as we live and die for each point or each tenth of a second, what we see reflected in the Olympic and Paralympic Games are simple truths of our common humanity; and that no matter who you are, where you're from, or what you look like, with hard work and dedication and discipline you can achieve your dreams. You can make it if you try.

What we see is that although we may come from vastly different stories and very different walks of life, we are one people who possess common values and common ideals; who celebrate individual excellence but also share a recognition that together, we can accomplish great and wonderful things we can't accomplish alone.

It's the stuff from which our young nation was forged, and it is a set of timeless values that serves as the underpinnings of the Olympic spirit. And so the United States of America does more than just stand behind the Olympic and Paralympic Games -- we stand behind their ideals.

And that's why we've created the first ever Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport right here in the White House. (Applause.) Now, this office does the work of coordinating with federal agencies to support and promote Olympic and Paralympic Games, but it also works to support and promote the Olympic spirit. We've been working hand in hand with Chicago 2016, the United States Olympic Committee, Olympians and Paralympians -- some of whom have joined us here today -- to get our young Americans active and involved in sports, because we want to do more than just bring the Olympic Games to America -- we want them to create a lasting legacy here in America.

I want to thank the members of the International Olympic Committee for their dedication to the Olympic and Paralympic movement and the values it represents. I am confident that they'll find no greater partners than the City of Chicago and the American people to fuel this movement, to ignite it in new generations, and to inspire the world in 2016 with magnificent Games that bring this world together in noble competition and shared celebration of our common humanity.

The energy, excitement, and enthusiasm on display at the White House here today, these aren't new. The folks gathered here this afternoon have had the Olympic spirit blazing within them for years, working tirelessly to bring these Games to the city and the country we love. And, I promise you, we are fired up about this.

I would make the case in Copenhagen personally, if I weren't so firmly committed to making -- making real the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American. But the good news is I'm sending a more compelling superstar to represent the city and country we love, and that is our First Lady, Michelle Obama. (Applause.) She's going because she and I share the conviction that bringing the Games to the United States isn't just important for the city, but for the American people. And I'm confident she, and my senior advisor and Director of the White House Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport, Valerie Jarrett, will represent the American people well.

Our nation, from the local to the national level, is committed to the success of these Games. The Chicago City Council unanimously supports this bid. Both Houses of the United States Congress support this bid. I support this bid. And on behalf of the nearly 20,000 volunteers, the more than 1 million who've already signed up in support, and all who've already taken up this cause and made it their own -- first as the cause of the city, and now the cause of a nation -- the United States supports this bid.

Americans, like Chicagoans -- we don't like to make small plans. We want to dream big and reach high. We hope deeply. We want these Games. And if you choose Chicago, I promise you this: Chicago will make America proud, and America will make the world proud.

So as I said when we first were announcing this bid in Chicago, let the Games begin right here in the United States of America. Thank you.

He didn't 'torpedo it.' He intervened in a bid that really didn't have the backing of the people of the state. He should have avoided this.

Don't get me wrong, I think Chicago is an awesome city, but it's very corrupt, in a state that is very corrupt. We cannot afford this, in spite of the Daley spin and the benefits that would have accrued to the Obama folks.

</quote>

i thought it was also very interesting in them calling Chicago a "safe" city

</quote>

Compared to Rio, most definitely so.

</quote>

Indeed, it is a 'safe' city, as far as cities go. I spend alot of time in Chicago, neighborhoods, not just downtown. You do need to know the neighborhoods, but easy enough to find out about.

Gangs? Certainly and they ARE dangerous. On the other hand, knowing where the problem areas are will go a long way to making the city not only accessible, but comfortable. Also allow for travel outside of expressways, which can save hours of driving. Got to stay up-to-date however. A few years ago the "Austin" area would have been considered 'avoid at all costs', today, it's gentrifying. West side. 'Nuff said'.

Obama is really projecting himself. The IOC told him today to take a hike, and they weren't buying it.

Actually, it seems that Obama went to Copenhagen to talk to General Crystal at a "face to face" about Afghanistan. I suspect that even though Obama did talk with the committee about the Olympics, he wanted to keep a low profile about his meeting with General Crystal.

The Olympics brought hefty profits at Los Angeles and Atlanta. Big cities already have the facilities to host such an event. It means jobs for Americans and money coming into the country.

Can't figure out why Republicans are so anti-American. They want the President to FAIL. They want sick people to "Die Quickly". They want to destroy the Middle Class. They only care about the rich even when most aren't AND the rich move our jobs overseas. Are they stupid, 'tarded, anti American or all three?

Correct on Both Counts. Obama made it about him and his 'Adopted Hometown', and South America has never hosted the event.

I hope RIO can handle it. This country cannot handle any more such venues when belt-tightening is going on, and NO city in this country can afford the bill until things change. I don't see us pulling out anytime soon, and I means YEARS and Government is changed dratically.

We will be in the rears for DECADES and trillions for decades to come.

Obama's focus is one of cause celeb, and hero-worship...regardless of cost.

Hey, ASSHOLE -- Here's the text of his speech, only two paragraphs of which did he talk about HIS Chicago roots.

Full Text of Obama Olympics Speech

Thank you, everybody. Thank you. It is true that I always wanted to fence and I thought that would be cool. So I might get a couple tips from you guys.

Now you see one of the reasons that I love Chicago so much. It's the city where I met the woman I love.

Sixteen days away -- we're just 16 days away from the deciding vote on which world city will host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

So let's get right down to business here: The United States is eager to welcome the world to our shores. This nation would be honored to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and to serve as host to thousands of athletes and millions of visitors from around the world. And within this great country of ours, there is no better city than that than Chicago, Illinois.

Now, I may live in Washington these days. I love Washington, D.C. And our house here is a little bigger than the one we got in Chicago. (Laughter.) But I've called Chicago home for nearly 25 years. It's a city of broad shoulders and big hearts and bold dreams; a city of legendary sports figures, legendary sports venues, and legendary sports fans; a city like America itself, where the world -- the world's races and religions and nationalities come together and reach for the dream that brought them here.

In Chicago, old and new exist in harmony. It's a city rooted in an industrial past that laid this nation's railroads, forged this nation's steel, rebuilt itself after a great fire, and reversed the course of a mighty river. And it's also a city of bustle and gleaming promise that Mayor Daley has pledged to make the greenest in America. And that's why I think that one of the most exciting parts of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is that all of the plans being made in Chicago exist within minutes of the city center; easily accessible to commerce and culture, parkland and water -- because we don't want these venues to be far-flung, all over the place. We want to host these Games where we live and work and play.

We want them in the heart of our proud city -- the city that opened the way westward in the 19th century, that showed the way skyward in the 20th century, and that is leading the way forward in the 21st century. So Chicago is ready. The American people are ready. We want these Games. We want them.

The Olympic and Paralympic Games, they hold a special place in our psyche. They lift us up. They bind us together. They're the sources of fleeting moments -- instants, really -- that have become permanently seared in our collective memories: The humble victory of Jesse Owens. The perfection of Nadia and Mary Lou. Michael Johnson's astonishment at his own feat. Derek Redmond and Kerri Strug bravely making it through with a little help. Jean Driscoll racing her wheelchair to gold after gold, be it over 100 meters or 26.2 miles. Moments of euphoria after years of hard work, and moments when the human spirit triumphed over injury that should have been impossible to overcome. Moments of a team's shared glory, and moments of lonely disappointment despite one's best efforts. Countless moments we live and relive again and again, silently and subconsciously, nodding yes, we do believe in miracles.

We find ourselves riveted by the Games. Because even as we cheer, even as we live and die for each point or each tenth of a second, what we see reflected in the Olympic and Paralympic Games are simple truths of our common humanity; and that no matter who you are, where you're from, or what you look like, with hard work and dedication and discipline you can achieve your dreams. You can make it if you try.

What we see is that although we may come from vastly different stories and very different walks of life, we are one people who possess common values and common ideals; who celebrate individual excellence but also share a recognition that together, we can accomplish great and wonderful things we can't accomplish alone.

It's the stuff from which our young nation was forged, and it is a set of timeless values that serves as the underpinnings of the Olympic spirit. And so the United States of America does more than just stand behind the Olympic and Paralympic Games -- we stand behind their ideals.

And that's why we've created the first ever Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport right here in the White House. (Applause.) Now, this office does the work of coordinating with federal agencies to support and promote Olympic and Paralympic Games, but it also works to support and promote the Olympic spirit. We've been working hand in hand with Chicago 2016, the United States Olympic Committee, Olympians and Paralympians -- some of whom have joined us here today -- to get our young Americans active and involved in sports, because we want to do more than just bring the Olympic Games to America -- we want them to create a lasting legacy here in America.

I want to thank the members of the International Olympic Committee for their dedication to the Olympic and Paralympic movement and the values it represents. I am confident that they'll find no greater partners than the City of Chicago and the American people to fuel this movement, to ignite it in new generations, and to inspire the world in 2016 with magnificent Games that bring this world together in noble competition and shared celebration of our common humanity.

The energy, excitement, and enthusiasm on display at the White House here today, these aren't new. The folks gathered here this afternoon have had the Olympic spirit blazing within them for years, working tirelessly to bring these Games to the city and the country we love. And, I promise you, we are fired up about this.

I would make the case in Copenhagen personally, if I weren't so firmly committed to making -- making real the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American. But the good news is I'm sending a more compelling superstar to represent the city and country we love, and that is our First Lady, Michelle Obama. (Applause.) She's going because she and I share the conviction that bringing the Games to the United States isn't just important for the city, but for the American people. And I'm confident she, and my senior advisor and Director of the White House Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport, Valerie Jarrett, will represent the American people well.

Our nation, from the local to the national level, is committed to the success of these Games. The Chicago City Council unanimously supports this bid. Both Houses of the United States Congress support this bid. I support this bid. And on behalf of the nearly 20,000 volunteers, the more than 1 million who've already signed up in support, and all who've already taken up this cause and made it their own -- first as the cause of the city, and now the cause of a nation -- the United States supports this bid.

Americans, like Chicagoans -- we don't like to make small plans. We want to dream big and reach high. We hope deeply. We want these Games. And if you choose Chicago, I promise you this: Chicago will make America proud, and America will make the world proud.

So as I said when we first were announcing this bid in Chicago, let the Games begin right here in the United States of America. Thank you.

This is a pretty pointless debate: If it had been a Republican doing the same thing, this thread would be exactly the same, with the responses flipped around. There is nothing objectable about what Obama did, but Republicans here hate him, so they'll bash him for it. If Bush had done the same it wouldn't have been objectable either, but you can rest assured the democrats (since they hated him), would've been crying about it too.

I predicted Rio would win it and I'm happy it did - it'll mark the first time in 48 years since Latin America hosted the games and that seems like a damn long time. And in fact, Brazil's hosting the two biggest sporting events in the world within 2 years of each other (BRAZIL 2014 WORLD CUP).

So yeah, hurray for them.

Face it folks, Obama the egomaniac shit the bed. HE went to Copenhagen and talked about how wonderful HE was. How happy HE'd be if Chicago was picked. How happy HIS daughters would be.

Hey, ASSHOLE -- Here's the text of his speech, only two paragraphs of which did he talk about HIS Chicago roots.

Full Text of Obama Olympics Speech

Thank you, everybody. Thank you. It is true that I always wanted to fence and I thought that would be cool. So I might get a couple tips from you guys.

Now you see one of the reasons that I love Chicago so much. It's the city where I met the woman I love.

Sixteen days away -- we're just 16 days away from the deciding vote on which world city will host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

So let's get right down to business here: The United States is eager to welcome the world to our shores. This nation would be honored to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and to serve as host to thousands of athletes and millions of visitors from around the world. And within this great country of ours, there is no better city than that than Chicago, Illinois.

Now, I may live in Washington these days. I love Washington, D.C. And our house here is a little bigger than the one we got in Chicago. (Laughter.) But I've called Chicago home for nearly 25 years. It's a city of broad shoulders and big hearts and bold dreams; a city of legendary sports figures, legendary sports venues, and legendary sports fans; a city like America itself, where the world -- the world's races and religions and nationalities come together and reach for the dream that brought them here.

In Chicago, old and new exist in harmony. It's a city rooted in an industrial past that laid this nation's railroads, forged this nation's steel, rebuilt itself after a great fire, and reversed the course of a mighty river. And it's also a city of bustle and gleaming promise that Mayor Daley has pledged to make the greenest in America. And that's why I think that one of the most exciting parts of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is that all of the plans being made in Chicago exist within minutes of the city center; easily accessible to commerce and culture, parkland and water -- because we don't want these venues to be far-flung, all over the place. We want to host these Games where we live and work and play.

We want them in the heart of our proud city -- the city that opened the way westward in the 19th century, that showed the way skyward in the 20th century, and that is leading the way forward in the 21st century. So Chicago is ready. The American people are ready. We want these Games. We want them.

The Olympic and Paralympic Games, they hold a special place in our psyche. They lift us up. They bind us together. They're the sources of fleeting moments -- instants, really -- that have become permanently seared in our collective memories: The humble victory of Jesse Owens. The perfection of Nadia and Mary Lou. Michael Johnson's astonishment at his own feat. Derek Redmond and Kerri Strug bravely making it through with a little help. Jean Driscoll racing her wheelchair to gold after gold, be it over 100 meters or 26.2 miles. Moments of euphoria after years of hard work, and moments when the human spirit triumphed over injury that should have been impossible to overcome. Moments of a team's shared glory, and moments of lonely disappointment despite one's best efforts. Countless moments we live and relive again and again, silently and subconsciously, nodding yes, we do believe in miracles.

We find ourselves riveted by the Games. Because even as we cheer, even as we live and die for each point or each tenth of a second, what we see reflected in the Olympic and Paralympic Games are simple truths of our common humanity; and that no matter who you are, where you're from, or what you look like, with hard work and dedication and discipline you can achieve your dreams. You can make it if you try.

What we see is that although we may come from vastly different stories and very different walks of life, we are one people who possess common values and common ideals; who celebrate individual excellence but also share a recognition that together, we can accomplish great and wonderful things we can't accomplish alone.

It's the stuff from which our young nation was forged, and it is a set of timeless values that serves as the underpinnings of the Olympic spirit. And so the United States of America does more than just stand behind the Olympic and Paralympic Games -- we stand behind their ideals.

And that's why we've created the first ever Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport right here in the White House. (Applause.) Now, this office does the work of coordinating with federal agencies to support and promote Olympic and Paralympic Games, but it also works to support and promote the Olympic spirit. We've been working hand in hand with Chicago 2016, the United States Olympic Committee, Olympians and Paralympians -- some of whom have joined us here today -- to get our young Americans active and involved in sports, because we want to do more than just bring the Olympic Games to America -- we want them to create a lasting legacy here in America.

I want to thank the members of the International Olympic Committee for their dedication to the Olympic and Paralympic movement and the values it represents. I am confident that they'll find no greater partners than the City of Chicago and the American people to fuel this movement, to ignite it in new generations, and to inspire the world in 2016 with magnificent Games that bring this world together in noble competition and shared celebration of our common humanity.

The energy, excitement, and enthusiasm on display at the White House here today, these aren't new. The folks gathered here this afternoon have had the Olympic spirit blazing within them for years, working tirelessly to bring these Games to the city and the country we love. And, I promise you, we are fired up about this.

I would make the case in Copenhagen personally, if I weren't so firmly committed to making -- making real the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American. But the good news is I'm sending a more compelling superstar to represent the city and country we love, and that is our First Lady, Michelle Obama. (Applause.) She's going because she and I share the conviction that bringing the Games to the United States isn't just important for the city, but for the American people. And I'm confident she, and my senior advisor and Director of the White House Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport, Valerie Jarrett, will represent the American people well.

Our nation, from the local to the national level, is committed to the success of these Games. The Chicago City Council unanimously supports this bid. Both Houses of the United States Congress support this bid. I support this bid. And on behalf of the nearly 20,000 volunteers, the more than 1 million who've already signed up in support, and all who've already taken up this cause and made it their own -- first as the cause of the city, and now the cause of a nation -- the United States supports this bid.

Americans, like Chicagoans -- we don't like to make small plans. We want to dream big and reach high. We hope deeply. We want these Games. And if you choose Chicago, I promise you this: Chicago will make America proud, and America will make the world proud.

So as I said when we first were announcing this bid in Chicago, let the Games begin right here in the United States of America. Thank you.

Republican trifecta. They want the president to fail. They hate the middle class. They only support rich people who move jobs overseas. They want America in war without supporting the troops.
The Republican party has lost it. 44,700 Americans die every year because they have no health insurance. Republicans say, "Die Quickly".

Agreed. And right now isn't the time to be adding to any debt to this Country, State, or Town/City until it is corrected, despite the 'Prestige' it might bring to that entity that would HOST the venue.

We have larger problems. And this is MY problem with Obama going to try to bring it to Chicago...and I'd say it about ANY city he tried to bring it to.

Thing is. *WE* cannot afford it until OUR HOUSE collectively is in ORDER no matter WHERE it would be held.

I don't think Chicago should of gotten the Olympics if you want my honest opinion. However, some people on this board today have been ridiculous about this topic. It also goes beyond the Olympics, it's more about Obama than the Olympics at this point to those same people.

Heres probably the best argument for people in Illinois on why the Olympics shouldnt come to Chicago:

<a href="http://www.pjstar.com/news/x41299157/Luciano-You-want-Olympics-pay-the-tab">Luciano: You want Olympics, pay the tab - Peoria, IL - pjstar.com</a>

President Obama wants the Olympics in Chicago.

This week, to help land the 2016 Olympics in his hometown, he gushed, "I promise you this: Chicago will make America proud, and America will make the world proud."

I wish he'd offer another pledge, to everyone in Illinois outside Chicago: "I promise you this: Chicago will pick up the tab. The state of Illinois will not fork over one penny."

It's only fair. If he wants to help Chicago, he should help the rest of us. And that means ensuring that we don't get stuck with the tab, if and when the Games run over budget.

That happens often, though some Olympiads have proven profitable for host cities. But here's the rub: there'd be billions of dollars up for bid, and - follow me here - we're talking about Chicago. Not only will every contractor have a hand out, but so will everyone with a tie to Chicago pols: friends, cousins, barbers, babysitters, you name it. Everyone will want a taste. It wouldn't be surprising to see the $4.8 billion budget spiral out of control......

Liberals will never admit it, but now that Obama has reached the highest political office he can, he has to govern, and he's bored. That's why he's so quick to run on late-night TV or to Denmark to campaign for the Olympics. Governance bores him, which is why he never tried to do it in the first place.

Sorry, but that was that is not the speech Obambi gave in Copenhagen. Who's the ASSHOLE now?? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>
HERE is his Copenhagen speech.
<quote>
THE PRESIDENT: President Rogge, ladies and gentlemen of the International Olympic Committee:

I come here today as a passionate supporter of the Olympic and Paralympic Games; as a strong believer in the movement they represent; and as a proud Chicagoan. But above all, I come as a faithful representative of the American people, and we look forward to welcoming the world to the shores of Lake Michigan and the heartland of our nation in 2016.

To host athletes and visitors from every corner of the globe is a high honor and a great responsibility. And America is ready and eager to assume that sacred trust. We're a nation that has always opened its arms to the citizens of the world -- including my own father from the African continent -- people who have sought something better; who have dreamed of something bigger.

I know you face a difficult choice among several great cities and nations with impressive bids of their own. So I've come here today to urge you to choose Chicago for the same reason I chose Chicago nearly 25 years ago -- the reason I fell in love with the city I still call home. And it's not just because it's where I met the woman you just heard from -- although after getting to know her this week, I k now you'll all agree that she's a pretty big selling point for the city.

You see, growing up, my family moved around a lot. I was born in Hawaii. I lived in Indonesia for a time. I never really had roots in any one place or culture or ethnic group. And then I c ame to Chicago. And on those Chicago streets, I worked alongside men and women who were black and white; Latino and Asian; people of every class and nationality and religion. I came to discover that Chicago is that most American of American cities, but one where citizens from more than 130 nations inhabit a rich tapestry of distinctive neighborhoods.

Each one of those neighborhoods -- from Greektown to the Ukrainian Village; from Devon to Pilsen to Washington Park -- has its own unique character, its own unique history, its songs, its language. But each is also part of our city -- one city -- a city where I finally found a home.

Chicago is a place where we strive to celebrate what makes us different just as we celebrate what we have in common. It's a place where our unity is on colorful display at so many festivals and parades, and especially sporting events, where perfect strangers become fast friends just because they're wearing the same jersey. It's a city that works -- from its first World's Fair more than a century ago to the World Cup we hosted in the nineties, we know how to put on big events. And scores of visitors and spectators will tell you that we do it well.

Chicago is a city where the practical and the inspirational exist in harmony; where visionaries who made no small plans rebuilt after a great fire and taught the world to reach new heights. It's a bustling metropolis with the warmth of a small town; where the world already comes together every day to live and work and reach for a dream -- a dream that no matter who we are, where we come from; no matter what we look like or what hand life has dealt us; with hard work, and discipline, and dedication, we can make it if we try.

That's not just the American Dream. That is the Olympic spirit. It's the essence of the Olympic spirit. That's why we see so much of ourselves in these Games. That's why we want them in Chicago. That's why we want them in America.

We stand at a moment in history when the fate of each nation is inextricably linked to the fate of all nations -- a time of common challenges that require common effort. And I ran for President because I believed deeply that at this defining moment, the United States of America has a responsibility to help in that effort, to forge new partnerships with the nations and the peoples of the world.

No one expects the Games to solve all our collective challenges. But what we do believe -- what each and every one of you believe and what all of the Chicago delegation believes -- is that in a world where we've all too often witnessed the darker aspects of our humanity, peaceful competition between nations represents what's best about our humanity. It brings us together, if only for a few weeks, face to face. It helps us understand one another just a little bit better. It reminds us that no matter how or where we differ, we all seek our own measure of happiness, and fulfillment, and pride in what we do. That's a very powerful starting point for progress.

Nearly one year ago, on a clear November night, people from every corner of the world gathered in the city of Chicago or in front of their televisions to watch the results of the U.S. Presidential election. Their interest wasn't about me as an individual. Rather, it was rooted in the belief that America's experiment in democracy still speaks to a set of universal aspirations and ideals. Their interest sprung from the hope that in this ever-shrinking world, our diversity could be a source of strength, a cause for celebration; and that with sustained work and determination, we could learn to live and prosper together during the fleeting moment we share on this Earth.

Now, that work is far from over, but it has begun in earnest. And while we do not know what the next few years will bring, there is nothing I w ould like more than to step just a few blocks from my family's home, with Michelle and our two girls, and welcome the world back into our neighborhood.

At the beginning of this new century, the nation that has been shaped by people from around the world wants a chance to inspire it once more; to ignite the spirit of possibility at the heart of the Olympic and Paralympic movement in a new generation; to offer a stage worthy of the extraordinary talent and dynamism offered by nations joined together -- to host games that unite us in noble competition and shared celebration of our limitless potential as a people.

And so I urge you t o choose Chicago. I urge you to choose America. And if you do, if we walk this path together, then I promise you this: The city of Chicago and the United States of America will make the world proud. Thank you so much. (Applause.)

Hey, ASSHOLE -- Here's the text of his speech, only two paragraphs of which did he talk about HIS Chicago roots.

Full Text of Obama Olympics Speech

Thank you, everybody. Thank you. It is true that I always wanted to fence and I thought that would be cool. So I might get a couple tips from you guys.

Now you see one of the reasons that I love Chicago so much. It's the city where I met the woman I love.

Sixteen days away -- we're just 16 days away from the deciding vote on which world city will host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

So let's get right down to business here: The United States is eager to welcome the world to our shores. This nation would be honored to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and to serve as host to thousands of athletes and millions of visitors from around the world. And within this great country of ours, there is no better city than that than Chicago, Illinois.

Now, I may live in Washington these days. I love Washington, D.C. And our house here is a little bigger than the one we got in Chicago. (Laughter.) But I've called Chicago home for nearly 25 years. It's a city of broad shoulders and big hearts and bold dreams; a city of legendary sports figures, legendary sports venues, and legendary sports fans; a city like America itself, where the world -- the world's races and religions and nationalities come together and reach for the dream that brought them here.

In Chicago, old and new exist in harmony. It's a city rooted in an industrial past that laid this nation's railroads, forged this nation's steel, rebuilt itself after a great fire, and reversed the course of a mighty river. And it's also a city of bustle and gleaming promise that Mayor Daley has pledged to make the greenest in America. And that's why I think that one of the most exciting parts of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is that all of the plans being made in Chicago exist within minutes of the city center; easily accessible to commerce and culture, parkland and water -- because we don't want these venues to be far-flung, all over the place. We want to host these Games where we live and work and play.

We want them in the heart of our proud city -- the city that opened the way westward in the 19th century, that showed the way skyward in the 20th century, and that is leading the way forward in the 21st century. So Chicago is ready. The American people are ready. We want these Games. We want them.

The Olympic and Paralympic Games, they hold a special place in our psyche. They lift us up. They bind us together. They're the sources of fleeting moments -- instants, really -- that have become permanently seared in our collective memories: The humble victory of Jesse Owens. The perfection of Nadia and Mary Lou. Michael Johnson's astonishment at his own feat. Derek Redmond and Kerri Strug bravely making it through with a little help. Jean Driscoll racing her wheelchair to gold after gold, be it over 100 meters or 26.2 miles. Moments of euphoria after years of hard work, and moments when the human spirit triumphed over injury that should have been impossible to overcome. Moments of a team's shared glory, and moments of lonely disappointment despite one's best efforts. Countless moments we live and relive again and again, silently and subconsciously, nodding yes, we do believe in miracles.

We find ourselves riveted by the Games. Because even as we cheer, even as we live and die for each point or each tenth of a second, what we see reflected in the Olympic and Paralympic Games are simple truths of our common humanity; and that no matter who you are, where you're from, or what you look like, with hard work and dedication and discipline you can achieve your dreams. You can make it if you try.

What we see is that although we may come from vastly different stories and very different walks of life, we are one people who possess common values and common ideals; who celebrate individual excellence but also share a recognition that together, we can accomplish great and wonderful things we can't accomplish alone.

It's the stuff from which our young nation was forged, and it is a set of timeless values that serves as the underpinnings of the Olympic spirit. And so the United States of America does more than just stand behind the Olympic and Paralympic Games -- we stand behind their ideals.

And that's why we've created the first ever Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport right here in the White House. (Applause.) Now, this office does the work of coordinating with federal agencies to support and promote Olympic and Paralympic Games, but it also works to support and promote the Olympic spirit. We've been working hand in hand with Chicago 2016, the United States Olympic Committee, Olympians and Paralympians -- some of whom have joined us here today -- to get our young Americans active and involved in sports, because we want to do more than just bring the Olympic Games to America -- we want them to create a lasting legacy here in America.

I want to thank the members of the International Olympic Committee for their dedication to the Olympic and Paralympic movement and the values it represents. I am confident that they'll find no greater partners than the City of Chicago and the American people to fuel this movement, to ignite it in new generations, and to inspire the world in 2016 with magnificent Games that bring this world together in noble competition and shared celebration of our common humanity.

The energy, excitement, and enthusiasm on display at the White House here today, these aren't new. The folks gathered here this afternoon have had the Olympic spirit blazing within them for years, working tirelessly to bring these Games to the city and the country we love. And, I promise you, we are fired up about this.

I would make the case in Copenhagen personally, if I weren't so firmly committed to making -- making real the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American. But the good news is I'm sending a more compelling superstar to represent the city and country we love, and that is our First Lady, Michelle Obama. (Applause.) She's going because she and I share the conviction that bringing the Games to the United States isn't just important for the city, but for the American people. And I'm confident she, and my senior advisor and Director of the White House Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport, Valerie Jarrett, will represent the American people well.

Our nation, from the local to the national level, is committed to the success of these Games. The Chicago City Council unanimously supports this bid. Both Houses of the United States Congress support this bid. I support this bid. And on behalf of the nearly 20,000 volunteers, the more than 1 million who've already signed up in support, and all who've already taken up this cause and made it their own -- first as the cause of the city, and now the cause of a nation -- the United States supports this bid.

Americans, like Chicagoans -- we don't like to make small plans. We want to dream big and reach high. We hope deeply. We want these Games. And if you choose Chicago, I promise you this: Chicago will make America proud, and America will make the world proud.

So as I said when we first were announcing this bid in Chicago, let the Games begin right here in the United States of America. Thank you.

Exactly. We have comittees that are HIRED for this job. Thus the entrance of Barack, Michelle, and the 'O'...They should have stayed out of it.

Obama in the effort to upstage those already paid to do so speaks to this.

</quote>

Yes there are committees but I still don't see why, if asked, Obama should have stayed out of it. He represents the U.S and is from Chicago and he most certainly is high profile. Why not do it?

</quote>

with all the stuff on his plate Bo he should not be concerned about a sporting event that will last 2 weeks and create some temporary jobs,and probably leaving Chicago more in debt then what they are........i liken this to Congress getting involved in the Baseball Steroids issue.....its not their place.....AND if this was LA,Denver,Seattle,Miami....would he have done the same?.....just wonderin.....

Agreed. And right now isn't the time to be adding to any debt to this Country, State, or Town/City until it is corrected, despite the 'Prestige' it might bring to that entity that would HOST the venue.

We have larger problems. And this is MY problem with Obama going to try to bring it to Chicago...and I'd say it about ANY city he tried to bring it to.

Thing is. *WE* cannot afford it until OUR HOUSE collectively is in ORDER no matter WHERE it would be held.

I don't think Chicago should of gotten the Olympics if you want my honest opinion. However, some people on this board today have been ridiculous about this topic. It also goes beyond the Olympics, it's more about Obama than the Olympics at this point to those same people.

actually, it seems that obama went to copenhagen to talk to general crystal at a "face to face" about afghanistan. i suspect that even though obama did talk with the committee about the olympics, he wanted to keep a low profile about his meeting with general crystal.

The olympics brought hefty profits at los angeles and atlanta. Big cities already have the facilities to host such an event. It means jobs for americans and money coming into the country.

Can't figure out why republicans are so anti-american. They want the president to fail. They want sick people to "die quickly". They want to destroy the middle class. They only care about the rich even when most aren't and the rich move our jobs overseas. Are they stupid, 'tarded, anti american or all three?

Political partisanship demonizes whoever the President is at the time.

Robert Welch Robert Welch of the John Birch Society, for instance, tried to link President Eisenhower with communism. " Mainstream Republicans such as William F. Buckley, Jr., and Russell Kirk grew increasingly unhappy with the society after Welch circulated a letter calling President Dwight D. Eisenhower a possible 'conscious, dedicated agent of the Communist Conspiracy.'[24] The controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of The Politician.[25] Welch also wrote that President Franklin D. Roosevelt knew about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in advance, but said nothing because he wanted to get the U.S. involved in World War II.[26] " <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society">John Birch Society - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>

Several of the farrightoid wingnuts here on the forum are in the Robert Welch/JBS class of screwballs, in my opinion.

You've been here since May, you don't know me. Besides, Dive and myself always go back and forth calling each other partisan. Mind your own business and don't act like your opinion is all knowing when it comes to myself because you don't know me. Just sayin my ass.

I don't blame Fox News for whatever reason. I'm stating the facts, did they not bash the Olympics coming possibly to Chicago the other night? Would they not continue to do so if Obama won? Will they not "put forth" and question how good he is on the international stage and how this will "damage" his reputation? The fact that you seem to think Faux News is a viable news source speaks volumes.

I mean holy shit, MSNBC would be doing the same thing if McCain was doing this. YOU need to stop being partisan in this case and take off the damn blinders. By the way, I don't "hate" Faux. Which is another case of you not knowing me at all.

Again, you also failed to read that I didn't think Chicago should get the Olympics. You're arguing from the stance that I did. Check yourself and stop taking out of context what I say.

I agree, we shouldn't have bases in all these countries. However, 2-1 says it isn't Liberals like myself who want that to continue. However, if people like me or you dare say such a thing, we'd be considered unAmerican including by several on this board.

China has the jobs because those U.S. companies invested in China have shown their true colors. It's not red, white, and blue, it's green. They don't give a fuck about the American worker or this country. All they care about is their profits. If they can make a couple extra million a year by running sweatshops in China, what do you think they will do?

I agree, we shouldn't have bases in all these countries. However, 2-1 says it isn't Liberals like myself who want that to continue. However, if people like me or you dare say such a thing, we'd be considered unAmerican including by several on this board.

China has the jobs because U.S. companies have shown their true colors. It's not red, white, and blue, it's green. They don't give a fuck about the American worker or this country. All they care about is their profits. If they can make a couple extra million a year by running sweatshops in China, what do you think they will do?

Perhaps YOU should learn the Context of the word Partisan ? Dive Nailed it based on your History of posting, and called you out on it? Just sayin'.

Youy seem to want to BLAME FOX NEWS for whatever reason, and your unseemingly HATRED of them pointing OUT the PAYBACK that would be afforded for "His Chosen CITY ' and the crooked politics/Politicians that stood to garner PAYBACK if Obama had suceeded.

You really need to dig deeper into things. Your posts belie even YOU.

You've been here since May, you don't know me. Besides, Dive and myself always go back and forth calling each other partisan. Mind your own business and don't act like your opinion is all knowing when it comes to myself because you don't know me. Just sayin my ass.

I don't blame Fox News for whatever reason. I'm stating the facts, did they not bash the Olympics coming possibly to Chicago the other night? Would they not continue to do so if Obama won? Will they not "put forth" and question how good he is on the international stage and how this will "damage" his reputation? The fact that you seem to think Faux News is a viable news source speaks volumes.

I mean holy shit, MSNBC would be doing the same thing if McCain was doing this. YOU need to stop being partisan in this case and take off the damn blinders. By the way, I don't "hate" Faux. Which is another case of you not knowing me at all.

Again, you also failed to read that I didn't think Chicago should get the Olympics. You're arguing from the stance that I did. Check yourself and stop taking out of context what I say.

You do misunderstand me. There was no "winning" for Obama in this. Whether he won or didn't win the Olympics for the U.S, those on the right would of been ready to bash the result.

My problem is people have made this issue more about Obama than the fact that Chicago is not really able to have an Olympics. However, people tend to ignore that Rio isn't really off any better. Which is why I supported Tokyo.

I never said Profit itself is not evil. Profit made off the backs of children in horrible sweatshops in China however is evil. THAT was my point being made. It would be stupid to say profit is evil.

Quite right - ineptness brought about by out of control arrogance.

Both he and Michelle made their pleas for Chicago about them - not Chicago, not America, not the spectacle of an athletic event.

Such arrogance is their undoing - a process that is happening before our eyes.

Perhaps the Obama's will grow up and develop past this stage, but they best do it quick or the outcome of a One-Termer presidency is a distinct possibility...

Sweatshops offer Chinese a better life. Usually, sweatshops pay far more than the jobs they had before, which are usually subsistence agriculture.

The biggest human migration ever has been in China as 100 million Chinese have moved from the inlands to the coastal regions to take advantage of the opening of the Chinese economy and the manufacturing plants that have set up there. Wages have skyrocketed and the greatest reduction of human poverty on the planet has occurred because of this.

Full Text of Obama Olympics Speech

Thank you, everybody. Thank you. It is true that I always wanted to fence and I thought that would be cool. So I might get a couple tips from you guys.

Now you see one of the reasons that I love Chicago so much. It's the city where I met the woman I love.

Sixteen days away -- we're just 16 days away from the deciding vote on which world city will host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

So let's get right down to business here: The United States is eager to welcome the world to our shores. This nation would be honored to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and to serve as host to thousands of athletes and millions of visitors from around the world. And within this great country of ours, there is no better city than that than Chicago, Illinois.

Now, I may live in Washington these days. I love Washington, D.C. And our house here is a little bigger than the one we got in Chicago. (Laughter.) But I've called Chicago home for nearly 25 years. It's a city of broad shoulders and big hearts and bold dreams; a city of legendary sports figures, legendary sports venues, and legendary sports fans; a city like America itself, where the world -- the world's races and religions and nationalities come together and reach for the dream that brought them here.

In Chicago, old and new exist in harmony. It's a city rooted in an industrial past that laid this nation's railroads, forged this nation's steel, rebuilt itself after a great fire, and reversed the course of a mighty river. And it's also a city of bustle and gleaming promise that Mayor Daley has pledged to make the greenest in America. And that's why I think that one of the most exciting parts of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is that all of the plans being made in Chicago exist within minutes of the city center; easily accessible to commerce and culture, parkland and water -- because we don't want these venues to be far-flung, all over the place. We want to host these Games where we live and work and play.

We want them in the heart of our proud city -- the city that opened the way westward in the 19th century, that showed the way skyward in the 20th century, and that is leading the way forward in the 21st century. So Chicago is ready. The American people are ready. We want these Games. We want them.

The Olympic and Paralympic Games, they hold a special place in our psyche. They lift us up. They bind us together. They're the sources of fleeting moments -- instants, really -- that have become permanently seared in our collective memories: The humble victory of Jesse Owens. The perfection of Nadia and Mary Lou. Michael Johnson's astonishment at his own feat. Derek Redmond and Kerri Strug bravely making it through with a little help. Jean Driscoll racing her wheelchair to gold after gold, be it over 100 meters or 26.2 miles. Moments of euphoria after years of hard work, and moments when the human spirit triumphed over injury that should have been impossible to overcome. Moments of a team's shared glory, and moments of lonely disappointment despite one's best efforts. Countless moments we live and relive again and again, silently and subconsciously, nodding yes, we do believe in miracles.

We find ourselves riveted by the Games. Because even as we cheer, even as we live and die for each point or each tenth of a second, what we see reflected in the Olympic and Paralympic Games are simple truths of our common humanity; and that no matter who you are, where you're from, or what you look like, with hard work and dedication and discipline you can achieve your dreams. You can make it if you try.

What we see is that although we may come from vastly different stories and very different walks of life, we are one people who possess common values and common ideals; who celebrate individual excellence but also share a recognition that together, we can accomplish great and wonderful things we can't accomplish alone.

It's the stuff from which our young nation was forged, and it is a set of timeless values that serves as the underpinnings of the Olympic spirit. And so the United States of America does more than just stand behind the Olympic and Paralympic Games -- we stand behind their ideals.

And that's why we've created the first ever Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport right here in the White House. (Applause.) Now, this office does the work of coordinating with federal agencies to support and promote Olympic and Paralympic Games, but it also works to support and promote the Olympic spirit. We've been working hand in hand with Chicago 2016, the United States Olympic Committee, Olympians and Paralympians -- some of whom have joined us here today -- to get our young Americans active and involved in sports, because we want to do more than just bring the Olympic Games to America -- we want them to create a lasting legacy here in America.

I want to thank the members of the International Olympic Committee for their dedication to the Olympic and Paralympic movement and the values it represents. I am confident that they'll find no greater partners than the City of Chicago and the American people to fuel this movement, to ignite it in new generations, and to inspire the world in 2016 with magnificent Games that bring this world together in noble competition and shared celebration of our common humanity.

The energy, excitement, and enthusiasm on display at the White House here today, these aren't new. The folks gathered here this afternoon have had the Olympic spirit blazing within them for years, working tirelessly to bring these Games to the city and the country we love. And, I promise you, we are fired up about this.

I would make the case in Copenhagen personally, if I weren't so firmly committed to making -- making real the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American. But the good news is I'm sending a more compelling superstar to represent the city and country we love, and that is our First Lady, Michelle Obama. (Applause.) She's going because she and I share the conviction that bringing the Games to the United States isn't just important for the city, but for the American people. And I'm confident she, and my senior advisor and Director of the White House Office of Olympic, Paralympic, and Youth Sport, Valerie Jarrett (aka: Candidate #1 as mentioned in the Blagojevich Indictment), will represent the American people well.

Our nation, from the local to the national level, is committed to the success of these Games. The Chicago City Council unanimously supports this bid. Both Houses of the United States Congress support this bid. I support this bid. And on behalf of the nearly 20,000 volunteers, the more than 1 million who've already signed up in support, and all who've already taken up this cause and made it their own -- first as the cause of the city, and now the cause of a nation -- the United States supports this bid (yeah, big fucking deal -- Obama's all over it).

Americans, like Chicagoans -- we don't like to make small plans. We want to dream big and reach high. We hope deeply. We want these Games. And if you choose Chicago, I promise you this: Chicago will make America proud, and America will make the world proud.

So as I said when we first were announcing this bid in Chicago, let the Games begin right here in the United States of America. Thank you.

However, parrots get annoying after awhile, which is exactly why I mentioned it to CF. Besides, CF is a hack and if you can't see that then you are really blind.

I noticed you ignored my brand new set of points. I also see you have refused to condemn Faux News. Thanks for showing your true colors, partisan.

You do misunderstand me. There was no "winning" for Obama in this. Whether he won or didn't win the Olympics for the U.S, those on the right would of been ready to bash the result.

My problem is people have made this issue more about Obama than the fact that Chicago is not really able to have an Olympics. However, people tend to ignore that Rio isn't really off any better. Which is why I supported Tokyo.

CHICAGO. Dec. 16 -- Antoin "Tony" Rezko is a political insider, an energetic Chicago dealmaker and campaign fundraiser often in the headlines for being on the wrong side of good government. Indicted in October on influence-peddling charges, he also has a habit of befriending prospective political stars.

I'm not defending Obama, I'm showing the stupidity of idiots like you. Again, I could care less about Obama, I really don't even support Obama anymore. He has shown himself to be not the candidate he ran his platform on. He has been anything but Liberal really. So when it comes to Liberals, I am one of those who probably bash him the most, especially when he follows Bush's policies that he promised to not do so.

At the end of the day though, you're still a partisan hack. Go learn to count, then come back here.

In case you didn't know we actually have Olympic committees NOT the POTUS that are assigned to go out &amp; SELL--all parts of this county.

Obama has kissed so much ass through-out the world--it's amazing that he still has lips.

Not only did he take himself --"Mr. Ego"--but took his wife--&amp; Opry Winfrey with him--while all along--MSN--NBC stated that Michell took the Gold Medal &amp; Barack took the Silver Medal while all along they (MSNBC &amp; CNN) were claiming it was in the bag.--They were SHOCKED TO LISTEN TO FIND OUT THAT CHICAGO WAS TURNED DOWN FIRST VOTE.

The conspiracy was that the President was only doing this pay back his "political cronies". Instead of, just maybe, because any and all presidents want the Olympics in America and if a bid were up for their hometown, all the better.

The conspiracy was that the President was only doing this pay back his "political cronies". Instead of, just maybe, because any and all presidents want the Olympics in America and if a bid were up for their hometown, all the better.

He may have MET with such a comittee...granted [YOU should post such a LINK]...but Benefit of DOUBT here?

Did he FLY AF ONE to Directly confront the Comitee? Did he RECRUIT his Spouse for the Endeavour?

Did he try to use 'STAR POWER' such as the 'O' to bring it home? [I hear Oparah is so depressed, she has EATEN Copenhagen, and worked her way to the Fjords in a fit of depression]...

You do misunderstand me. There was no "winning" for Obama in this. Whether he won or didn't win the Olympics for the U.S, those on the right would of been ready to bash the result.

My problem is people have made this issue more about Obama than the fact that Chicago is not really able to have an Olympics. However, people tend to ignore that Rio isn't really off any better. Which is why I supported Tokyo.

The Olympic Fiasco

...But even without the self-centered story-telling it was a hard sell anyway. How can a post-national, I’m sorry Obama, trapped in a sort of we are the world paradox, be seen in nationalistic and near tribal fashion stumping for his own home town? Again, it did not help that he appeared in campaign mode, tossing out the usual personal, somewhat hokey (and all but narcissistic) stories about himself and his family, that I know don’t resonate, much less make effective arguments, in the less therapeutic world of hardball politics abroad. In short, the community organizer was out organized by the multicultural ascendant Rio....

Sarkozy Drew Blood

Sarkozy really hurt Obama internationally, since his sarcastic ‘beam back down Barack’-like statement cut to the bone on the issue of such fluffy talk versus little substance: utopianism sermonizing on non-proliferation is great, but what about the spinning centrifuges? What does the Left do when the French are now to our Right? How can a weaker power sound braver than the stronger? And more principled? Europe is becoming worried, in the be careful what you wish for fashion about the Obama era, since the old bad cop/good cop game is up. It is now Europe good cop/US nicer cop. Much irony in this again…

2. We've been spied on since Echelon and Carnivore. All Internet traffic routes overseas through the fiber cable and friendly foreign government have been monitoring it for over 15 years now.

3. Bush liberated 50MM millions Muslims and toppled 2 state sponsors of terrorism post 9/11.

Well, the Dems had to redefine what torture was to make that be the case.

And spying on all of us isn't exactly what he was doing. Data mining wasn't a case of spying on all of us. It only focused on anyone who was planning to kill us in large numbers.

The only source of embarassment came from the Dems and their media. Compared to the sins of the rest of the world I think our's have been tame in comparison.

As an Obama supporter, I have to agree with you. Obama's advisors set him up big time on this one. They told him its in the bag. They told him Tony Blair and Putin made an appearance and it rubber stamped the application. Everything was supposed to be a formality.
In fact, Chicago never had a chance. Obama should have been told this. To travel half way around the world only to get a bitch slapping was humiliating. Not just to Obama but to the US.

Though I loath Obama and everything he stands for, I cringed when he embarrassed himself by flying to Denmark to beg them for the Olympics. It's a major, MAJOR embarrassment for America as a nation to have our President both get personally involved in a matter so trivial and then to get bitch slapped by nobodies.

As an Obama supporter, I have to agree with you. Obama's advisors set him up big time on this one. They told him its in the bag. They told him Tony Blair and Putin made an appearance and it rubber stamped the application. Everything was supposed to be a formality.
In fact, Chicago never had a chance. Obama should have been told this. To travel half way around the world only to get a bitch slapping was humiliating. Not just to Obama but to the US.
Somebody misread this one big time

Can't blame this on his handlers. Obama thinks his shit don't stink....so he felt just his wonderful presense would persuade them.

Truth is the rest of the world isn't buying his act and this just proves it.

The President of the United States is without doubt, the most powerful office in the entire world.

The Commander-in-Chief of the one remaining superpower on the planet.

Leader of the Free World.

In essence, the President of the United States wields the Earths most powerful military, economic, and political stick.

The pettiness was from Obama. His gigantic ego steered the man-child in the wrong direction. He believed that if he just "showed up" in Copenhagen the magnetic power of his personality would somehow hypnotize the IOC members and they would fall under his spell (like the mainstream media in the US) and vote for Chicago. They didn't. Instead, they shit right in his face and laughed at his impudence. He groveled in front of the world and looked like the political dilettante that he is. Obama spends his political capitol like it is taxpayer money. He doesn't realize that it is not a renewable resource. He is forever diminished by this foolish escapade.

The gloating you've noticed is a by-product of an image that this man can do no wrong...that he's so wonderful when in fact....he isn't.

Being picked by Europeans to allow the U.S. to host anything right now is a tall order.

Obama helped foster this.

I think it's poetic justice.

The fact that he has the "Audacity of hope" to think he could change their minds by gracing them with his wonderful presence is what is truly funny about all of this.

After 9-11, the British government presented George W. Bush with one their country's great modern treasures: a bust of Winston Churchill. President Bush prominently placed the iconic figure of vigilance and courage in the Oval Office. After Obama's inauguration the Brit's offered the prized possession to remain with America's new commander. Obama turned down the offer and had Churchill crated and shipped back to England. If you were warned this would occur, would you have believed it? Or would you have believed that, upon British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's first visit to the White House, our president would present the leader of our greatest ally with a tacky gift box of DVDs, including Psycho and The Godfather?

What's next after Obama's Olympic Humiliation?

Obama has to find another way for Jarrett to cash out.

<quote>
Jarrett is the chief executive of Habitat Co., which developed and managed large housing projects in and around Chicago -- and in Obama's state legislative district -- that were subsidized by federal and state housing dollars, and which were ultimately seized by federal authorities for what were unlivable conditions. While overseeing the company that managed these housing facilities, Jarrett also worked with long-time Obama friend and convicted felon Tony Rezko in raising money for Obama's political career.

</quote>

<a href="http://spectator.org/archives/2008/08/26/who-is-valerie-jarrett">Who Is Valerie Jarrett?</a>

Since Chicago lost the bid, Jarrett's Habitat Co. will most likely bankrupt due to the lack of federal funding. If Chicago won the Games, Olympic committee would most likely paid for upgrades for an Olympic village.

Though I loath Obama and everything he stands for, I cringed when he embarrassed himself by flying to Denmark to beg them for the Olympics. It's a major, MAJOR embarrassment for America as a nation to have our President both get personally involved in a matter so trivial and then to get bitch slapped by nobodies.

What's a Community Organizer to do?

</quote>

The embarrassment to America was brought upon ourselves by ourselves in that "we" (majority-wise speaking) voted for President Obama.

Beyond the fact that he has demonstrated beyond a doubt that the world doesn't stop hating America just because we elected that lightweight to high office, the bitch-slapping President Obama received at the hands of the IOC was just plain funny!

I laughed out loud -- literally. I had JUST discussed the prosepect with a conservative friend. We thought that if Impeached and Disgraced Former President Clinton had enough savvy not to go get our reporters back from N. Korea without first having the deal approved in advance, that surely President Obama (experienced communist -- err -- community organizer that he is) would be savvy enough not to place his own stock on the line without having assurance that it was a done deal.

But nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Mere moments later I happily texted my friend to announce the amazingly humorous news. :

Not a lot of difference there, friend. You're just on the opposite side of the mirror.

The only ones who call him messiah and the other shit are those on the right trying to knock him down and then they blame the left for saying it.

You lost. Get over it. It's called an election. You will have another chance in 8 years. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

What is really intersting and hypocritical is the reactions from the right about seccession, a coup, etc. Had anyone on the left talked like some of your loonies on the right, they would have been arrested and locked up.

In fact, one couple who just wore ban Bush shirts were arrested.

But to the poor wrong righties it's just fucking okay to bring guns to a presidential speech.

This is what happens when you go around bad-mouthing your own country for months. Who would want to come here after hearing what the president has had to say about it?

I could agree to some point with this. Here is where we apart:

It's not about (fading) popularity, it's about ego. The actual issue of the Olympics is insignificant to the US. Having or not having the Olympics will not increase/decrease our global credibility or legitimacy. For Obama to get involved was purely a personal choice, one no US president has ever made before. He went to Copenhagen, lifted his chin, glanced over teleprompters couple of times and thought: "I got this".

IOC simply replied: "No, you don't."

Chicago spent at least $50 million on a bid for the Olympics.

Mayor Richard Daley hadn't even arrived at the Copenhagen conference center, where IOC members commenced their early-evening selection process, when word came that Chicago had been eliminated in the first round of secret balloting, taking only 18 of the 94 votes cast.

The embarrassment to America was brought upon ourselves by ourselves in that "we" (majority-wise speaking) voted for President Obama.

Beyond the fact that he has demonstrated beyond a doubt that the world doesn't stop hating America just because we elected that lightweight to high office, the bitch-slapping President Obama received at the hands of the IOC was just plain funny!

I laughed out loud -- literally. I had JUST discussed the prosepect with a conservative friend. We thought that if Impeached and Disgraced Former President Clinton had enough savvy not to go get our reeporters back from N. Korea without first having the deal approved in advance, that surely President Obama (experienced communist -- err -- community organizer that he is) would be savvy enough not to place his own stock on the line without having assurance that it was a done deal.

But nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Mere moments later I happily texted my friend to announce the amazingly humorous news. :

I don't get how Chicago's failure to draw the olympics there is that funny unless you're just looking to slam Obama at any moment you can find, but meh.

I think it would be impossible to ascend to arguably the most powerful job in the world and still be a humble man of the people. It's just not possible.
And I can see how he would come off like an ego-maniac to people who don't like him anyway.

Keep telling yourself that.

The reason it is such a crushing defeat is because of Obama's ego. Many that supported Obama honestly felt he could do no wrong. I know someone myself who feels that way and they were crushed when they discovered that Obama couldn't sell it.

Yes you have to have an ego to be POTUS, but nobody in recent knowledge exhibits the kind of overblown ego Obama exhibits every single day.

GW didn't give speeches with a made up "Office of the President Elect" seal on the podium. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

GW didn't treat our British allies with distain when they offered a hand in friendship like Obama did. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_snooty.gif"/>

GW didn't bad mouth all of the news organizations that criticised him continually for 8 solid years like Obama does with Fox News nor did he personally attack voters who voiced their opposition to his policies. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/disagree.gif"/>

GW didn't appear on the TV almost every day of the week just so he can act like he's the POTUS. The level of overexposure we're getting of Obama is making alot of us tired of seeing and hearing him. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/gives.gif"/>

GW didn't force the networks to dump their regular programming to cover his speeches to the level Obama does. Each speech takes an hour and ad revenue is lost to the tune of $3 million dollars per station. And it looks like with every hour long address the ratings are continually going down so fewer and fewer are listening. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/blahblah.gif"/>

GW didn't conduct a joint session of Congress to give a fake State of the Union address. Obama has already had two in his first 9 months of office. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/udaman.gif"/>

It's the fact that he did so while generals are on a battlefield waiting to hear HIS strategy. Whether or not he talks to the generals directly or through the SECDEF isn't important. The important thing is that combat commanders had to wait for Obama to make a PR splash before they could hear from him what his plan for winning the war in Afghanistan. And even so, as far as I know, he still hasn't articulated his strategy yet.

It seems that Democrats are always trying to be nice to our enemies while they're leaving our troops in harms way.

When something happens that shows this policy is a mistake they pull us out.

I think Obama is waiting for some huge event where hundreds of our troops are killed so he can pull out.

Desert Storm was a massive success unless you forgot. Just because it happened with a minimum of casualties doesn't make it out to be a joke. Just think how bad it could have been and consider us lucky. However, the only reason it happened that way was because of a good plan and the way it was carried out.

Somalia was a goat-fuck.

Afghanistan is quickly turning into the same.

Just to be fair, Clinton and the Democrats weren't the only ones to come up with ridiculous ROE. Same things happened in Beirut during the Reagan administration leading up to the barracks bombing. For example, in 1983, Marines could not load their weapons if assigned to "low risk posts." This was done primarily as a safety issue so that Marines wouldn't have any accidental discharges of their weapons. Well, problem is that the barracks, by definition, was considered a "low risk post." Conversely, the ROE in Bosnia, at least during the first year, were pretty reasonable. If I thought my life was threatened, I had the right to defend myself with deadly force. I didn't have to ask for permission; I didn't have to wait until fired upon; if it looked like the other guy was even thinking about it, I was authorized to act.

I'm not trying to defend the Obama administration nor the Clinton administration. I think this goes beyond partisan politics and has more to do with how squeamish the American people are across the board when it comes to combat. Remember the Highway of Death in Desert Storm? The decision to engage the fleeing Iraqi forces was the right thing to do. What Americans don't understand is that when you decide to engage the enemy, you're not out to make it fair or to give him a chance to fight back: you destroy the enemy with total and complete brutality. That's what we did in 1991. But once the American public saw the images of burnt out civilian vehicles that the Iraqi troops had commandeered to get out of Kuwait, it got pretty squeamish pretty quickly.

It's things like this that politically drive how ROE are defined. We don't want to appear brutal. But war is brutal. The one who is the most ruthless wins. It's been that way ever since the first caveman picked up a rock and bashed the brains out of his enemy.

When it comes to ROE, we're pretty bi-partisan at being wimpy about it.

I belive this to be correct. Obama is under relentless pressure to end our endeavours overseas by the extreme left.

But I find it curious that Under Bush Iraq, was the " wrong war " to them and they supported what was happening in Afghanistan.

Now that the Left has solid numbers in both houses and the WH? That tune has changed.

Of course we know what the intent is. And you are spot-on.

Though I loath Obama and everything he stands for, I cringed when he embarrassed himself by flying to Denmark to beg them for the Olympics. It's a major, MAJOR embarrassment for America as a nation to have our President both get personally involved in a matter so trivial and then to get bitch slapped by nobodies.

What's a Community Organizer to do?

</quote>

The embarrassment to America was brought upon ourselves by ourselves in that "we" (majority-wise speaking) voted for President Obama.

Beyond the fact that he has demonstrated beyond a doubt that the world doesn't stop hating America just because we elected that lightweight to high office, the bitch-slapping President Obama received at the hands of the IOC was just plain funny!

I laughed out loud -- literally. I had JUST discussed the prosepect with a conservative friend. We thought that if Impeached and Disgraced Former President Clinton had enough savvy not to go get our reeporters back from N. Korea without first having the deal approved in advance, that surely President Obama (experienced communist -- err -- community organizer that he is) would be savvy enough not to place his own stock on the line without having assurance that it was a done deal.

But nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Mere moments later I happily texted my friend to announce the amazingly humorous news. :

President Obama turns out not to be nearly as smart as even Impeached and Disgraced Former President Clinton!

</quote>

I don't get how Chicago's failure to draw the olympics there is that funny unless you're just looking to slam Obama at any moment you can find, but meh.

I'm still wondering if any reports came out on WHY the IOC threw Chicago out in the first round of voting.

</quote>

It's funny because the man-child we elected President demonstrated -- in a clear and embarrassing fashion -- that he is indeed a lightweight novice. His ego led him to conclude that going there to won'erful won'erful Copenhagen would seal the deal! And his ego took a bruising. I think that's a rup. PART of the reason is that I politically oppose almost everything President Obama stands for. So his failures are relished.

But PART of the reason was more pragmatic. Chicago cannot afford to do all that is necessary to get itself ready to host the Olympics. Not today. Not in 6 to 7 more years. Therefore, the costs would almost certainly be picked up by the U.S. Treasury in one way or another. OUR Tax Dollars hard at work for the Chicago thugacracy. No thanks.

I don't care why the IOC tossed Chicago out in round one. (A nice little exclamation point to the sound thumping they were giving to the President!) I am just truly pleased that they did so.

And if it underscores that President Obama, the empty suit in chief, is an assclown, so much the better.

No. Their egos were not anywhere nearly as much on the line as the manchild we have as our "leader."

It was Rio's time.

Good.

I agree with DiveCon. I think it was pretty obvious that the odds favored Rio for several good reasons, already mentioned in this thread. Great. So why did President Obama put so much of his own political "stock" at risk on an odds-against gamble? Because he's a not particularly savvy rookie with a bunch of jackass advisors letting him down. Hard.

And I love it. The worse his insufferable ego gets battered, the better off all of us might end up.

The unfortunate reality is that politics will always drive ROE, especially in today's world with incidents on the battlefield being posted over the internet within minutes of them occurring. A few years ago, a Marine clearing a house shot a wounded insurgent in the head and killed him. This was cause celebre for anti-war fanatics as a demonstration of how brutal the US military is towards unarmed civilians.

Anyone who's put on a uniform and walked with the Devil in the dark of night knows that there is a huge difference between an unarmed combatant who identifies himself, throws his arms up in surrender and fully cooperates as opposed to a person who is faking that he is dead. You search and detain the first one and you kill the second one. It's that simple.

But the folks who criticize this have never experienced the harsh reality of war. Unfortunately, I'm pretty certain that the world-wide internet publicity of this shooting probably resulted in more restrictive ROE. Like you said, it shouldn't happen, but politics will always factor into ROE.

To be gleefull that we as America lost the Olympic bid....is un American Glenn Beck and Rush. You are such hacks...you see it as a win we lost the bid. All this proves is no matter what, if Obama wants it, you are against it.

I could say the same for the way the Dems treated Abu Grab and Katrina.

Also the way they treated everything bad that has happened to us the last several years.

I would have to say this was a more personal failure that could in all honesty be laid directly at the feet of the Messiah himself.

The difference being nobody got killed as a result of it. So the criticism isn't as much in the gutter as when the Dems were doing it to Bush.

I am glad Chicago lost, but not for the reasons you think. "We as America" did not lose the Olympic bid. A bunch of corrupt Chicago sleazebags lost. I don't think lining the pockets of Mayor Daly and his political machine is a good use of public funds. The games would have been financed by the public and once again the public would get screwed. Chicago lost because it is a sleazy town with too much crime. Having a few high profile murders just before the voting took place didn't help either! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Obama lent his fading credibility to the effort and that was a mistake.

Well, testing the sense of humor in this forum, when I heard the news, I said to a coworker, "Oh, so instead of getting terrorized by gang members on the streets of Chicago, tourists will be terrorized by Brazilian drug lords instead."

Rio has it's own set of problems, that's for sure. But at least the US Taxpayer won't be paying for it.

I stand corrected on an earlier post I made. Apparently Obama did spend some time with General McChrystal while in Copenhagen. What still burns me about this is that there still was no final decision at the end of this meeting, and Obama is going to refer to his other advisors before making a final decision. Not that there's anything overtly wrong with this, but McChrystal IS the man on the ground. His word should have considerable influence over the others who are NOT on the ground. Seems to me that Obama is doing this backwards.

I can't rule out in my mind that this was a hastily-thrown together version of the Beer Summit designed to placate Obama's critics in the wake of the recent bad press, and that this meeting was more appearance than substance.

Pet peeve: White House photos showing Obama sans coat and tie with sleeves rolled up while meeting with General McChrystal. He's the President of the United States and ought to look like it! But this is just a personal pet peeve of mine, and I freely admit it.

What rubbish.

America didn't lose the Olympic bid. Chicago did. Chicago is IN the United States of America but is not itself THE United States of America.

But it was destined to be America that ended up footing the bill. So, you're damn right I am VERY happy that Chicago lost that bid. Good news for Rio <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/> and good news for America. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

Further, it comes with the extra added beneficial bonus of bitch-slapping down the President's inflated ego. That too holds the promise of serving America's long term interests.

Just because your messiah wants it is not a good enough reason for the rest of us to hope is hack-ish dreams come true.

The McChrystal visit was clearly a photo-op. The rolled up sleeves were an example of it.....meant to show that Obama was rolling up his sleeves and doing his job.

He spent a grand total of 25 mins talking to his senior commander on the ground in Afghanistan. Hardly enough time to ask him how the wife and kids are doing.

Les' see heah. Follow Zander and the loonies or believe Morning Joe's take. Yep, not hard.

The Dems and the liberals in our high schools and universities are going to show the hole in contoid critical thinking on this one. The contoids are giving their children away to their enemies, and apparently doing it willingly.

Hey, Republicans, stop being the "party of no", get some respectable leaders, and come up with a believable and workable program. The Dems took more than ten years and six election cycles to understand that basic fact.
