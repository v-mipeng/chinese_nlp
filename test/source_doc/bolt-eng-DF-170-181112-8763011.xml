I could have buried this in one of the many existing threads on Fracking, but it deserves it's own look.

The article touches on the effects of increased U.S. natural gas production in far-flung parts of the world including the Middle East, China, Russia, Venezuela, etc.

The U.S. shale gas boom has not only virtually eliminated the need for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports for at least two decades, but significantly reduced Russias influence over the European natural gas market and "diminished the petro-power" of major gas producers in the Middle East and Venezuela.

And here's the kicker - Obama's proposed tax policies are directed at bringing the American oil and natural gas industries to it's knees:

Changes to U.S. tax policy for upstream oil and gas, including proposed changes to expensing rules, investment credits, and/or royalty rates, could also make shale exploration and production unprofitable at current prices.

Obama will use the governments political arm called the EPA to stop us from Fracking.

This is so preliminary and fraught with potential errors. Why was this "report" released so early?

Here are some hard documented facts regarding agrigulture and livestock pollution:

•California officials identify agriculture, including cows, as the major source of nitrate pollution in more than 100,000 square miles of polluted groundwater.

•In Oklahoma, nitrates from Seaboard Farms' hog operations contaminated drinking water wells, prompting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue an emergency order in June 2001 requiring the company to provide safe drinking water to area residents.

•In 1996 the Centers for Disease Control established a link between spontaneous abortions and high nitrate levels in Indiana drinking water wells located close to feedlots.

•High levels of nitrates in drinking water also increase the risk of methemoglobinemia, or "blue-baby syndrome," which can kill infants.

•Animal waste contains disease-causing pathogens, such as Salmonella, E. coli, Cryptosporidium, and fecal coliform, which can be 10 to 100 times more concentrated than in human waste. More than 40 diseases can be transferred to humans through manure.

•In May 2000, 1,300 cases of gastroenteritis were reported and six people died as the result of E. coli contaminating drinking water in Walkerton, Ontario. Health authorities determined that the most likely source was cattle manure runoff.

•Manure from dairy cows is thought to have contributed to the disastrous Cryptosporidium contamination of Milwaukee's drinking water in 1993, which killed more than 100 people, made 400,000 sick and resulted in $37 million in lost wages and productivity.

•In this country, roughly 29 million pounds of antibiotics -- about 80 percent of the nation's antibiotics use in total -- are added to animal feed every year to speed livestock growth. This widespread use of antibiotics on animals contributes to the rise of resistant bacteria, making it harder to treat human illnesses.

•Large hog farms emit hydrogen sulfide, a gas that most often causes flu-like symptoms in humans, but at high concentrations can lead to brain damage. In 1998, the National Institute of Health reported that 19 people died as a result of hydrogen sulfide emissions from manure pits.

Shall we shut down farming and livestock production?

Even if tremors occurred, the magnitude of any future tremors would be no more than around 3 on the Richter scale as a "worst-case scenario", it said.

</quote>

Magnitude 3 earthquakes don't count. You would basically have to be standing on the fault line to even feel it, even then you might not notice. No one would be injured and no damage would be done. I used to live in California, and I can tell you that most people don't notice anything below a 4.0. Personally I have not even noticed low 4's.

Anyhow- getting back to the first post- the practice of hydraulic fracturing which has been employed for nearly 60 years is just now granting the U.S. access to previously untapped reserves of hydrocarbons. In so much that it is turning world energy markets upside down and rewriting the hydrocarbon-political landscape.

Obama doesn't recognise this. He isn't capable of connecting the dots. He'll choose to stamp our nation's true assets into oblivion while outsourcing real economic development in the name such noble causes as perceived environmental gain and redistribution of wealth from the true creators of commerce to the non-productive consumer.

Wall Street Journal Spins Fracking Study To Downplay Risks
June 28, 2011 4:46 pm ET
A Wall Street Journal editorial obscured the fact that a Duke University study strongly suggested methane from a natural gas extraction process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, contaminated water supplies.

WSJ Dismisses Duke University Findings On Methane Contamination
WSJ Suggested There Is No Evidence The High Methane Concentration Was From Fracking Operations. The editorial said of the Duke study: "They had no baseline data and thus no way of knowing if methane concentrations were high prior to drilling":

A second charge, based on a Duke University study, claims that fracking has polluted drinking water with methane gas. Methane is naturally occurring and isn't by itself harmful in drinking water, though it can explode at high concentrations. Duke authors Rob Jackson and Avner Vengosh have written that their research shows "the average methane concentration to be 17 times higher in water wells located within a kilometer of active drilling sites."

They failed to note that researchers sampled a mere 68 wells across Pennsylvania and New York--where more than 20,000 water wells are drilled annually. They had no baseline data and thus no way of knowing if methane concentrations were high prior to drilling. They also acknowledged that methane was detected in 85% of the wells they tested, regardless of drilling operations, and that they'd found no trace of fracking fluids in any wells. [Wall Street Journal, 6/25/11]

In Fact, Duke Geochemical Analysis Strongly Suggested The Wells Are Source Of Water Contamination. The Journal editorial failed to mention that "that the type of gas detected at high levels in the water was the same type of gas that energy companies were extracting from thousands of feet underground," as reported by ProPublica:

Fracking wastewater becoming leading environmental issue...
<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cool.gif"/>
Ohio quakes could incite fracking policy shift
Tue Jan 3,`12  In Ohio, geographically and politically positioned to become a leading importer of wastewater from gas drilling, environmentalists and lawmakers opposed to the technique known as fracking are seizing on a series of small earthquakes as a signal to proceed with caution.

<quote>
Earthquakes caused by the injection of wastewater that's a byproduct of high-pressure hydraulic fracture drilling, aren't new. Yet earthquakes have a special ability to grab public attention. That's especially true after Saturday's quake near Youngstown, at magnitude 4.0 strong enough to be felt across hundreds of square miles. Gov. John Kasich, a drilling proponent, has shut down the wastewater well on which the quake has been blamed, along with others in the area, as the seismic activity is reviewed. "Drilling's very important for our economy and to help us progress as a state, but every single person in the Mahoning Valley felt this earthquake," said state Sen. Joe Schiavoni, a Youngstown Democrat who on Tuesday called for a public hearing. "I wouldn't deem it as an emergency, but when you live in a place that you're not used to earthquakes and you have 11 earthquakes, you're concerned," he said. "We need to give them some sort of confidence or security that this is going to be OK."

Fracking involves blasting millions of gallons of water, laced with chemicals and sand, deep into the ground to unlock vast reserves of natural gas, a boon both for energy companies and a public hungry for cheap sources of fuel. That process, though, leaves behind toxic wastewater that must be expensively treated or else pumped deep into the earth. The wastewater is extremely briny and can contain toxic chemicals from the drilling process  and sometimes radioactivity from deep underground. The practice of dumping underground has been controversial in light of scant research done on potential environmental dangers, highlighted by reports of contamination of aquifers in some communities in Pennsylvania and Wyoming. Some states are reconsidering it.

A coalition of environmental groups is preparing a protest for next week's return of the Ohio Legislature. Activists opposed to increased oil and gas drilling activity across Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia  where the Utica and Marcellus Shale formations are believed to hold vast quantities of gas  see trouble with the Ohio injection well. It took wastewater from fracking, as well as other forms of drilling. "What other business or industry isn't held accountable for its full cradle-to-grave processes?" said Deborah Nardone, director of the Sierra Club's Natural Gas Campaign. "They need to be responsible for the waste stream that they've created." Ohio's closure of the well will have little to no impact on drilling, said Travis Windle, a spokesman for the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry group based in Pennsylvania. Four of the five wells that Ohio shut down were not operational, Windle said.

Pennsylvania's drillers have turned in recent months to deep-well injection of millions of gallons of wastewater because of a voluntary state moratorium last year on dumping of waste at treatment plants where the partially treated liquids are discharged into rivers and streams that drinking water is taken from. Most drillers in Pennsylvania accepted a voluntary state moratorium last year on dumping of waste at treatment plants, which had discharged the partially treated mix into rivers and streams that supply drinking water. Many drillers now recycle the drilling fluid, and some turned to deep-well injection of millions of gallons of the wastewater. Pennsylvania has six deep injection wells that currently accept fracking fluid, said Amanda Witman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection. But some of its waste is trucked into Ohio, where the geology allows for more injection wells.

Yep. Pay attention to the bolded part where they claim it's a proprietary secret.

And............if the fluid is so safe, why are so many states requiring the following?

<quote>
Colorado and Texas have joined Pennsylvania in adopting rules requiring drilling companies to disclose the concentrations of all chemicals in hydraulic fracturing, the controversial procedure that injects millions of gallons underground to free natural gas and oil.

The guidelines that Colorado's regulators approved Tuesday are similar to those required by a law passed in Texas this year but go further by requiring the concentrations of chemicals to be disclosed. Colorado's rule takes effect in April.

Pennsylvania has regulations in place requiring drillers to disclose on a well-by-well basis the additives and chemicals used in fracturing fluid injected deep underground into oil and natural gas wells.

The state Department of Environmental Protection's website lists 70 chemicals and additives companies commonly use in fracking fluid, but it does not post on its website the hydraulic fluid contents used at specific wells or by the companies that supply the drillers with fracking fluid.

Some of that information is disclosed on the FracFocus.org website. But those seeking that specific information on the chemicals used in a well must get such a report at the Department of Environmental Protection's regional offices. The agency's office on Washington's Landing in Pittsburgh covers 10 Southwestern Pennsylvania counties.

In the case of Colorado, drillers claiming that the fluid's contents are a trade secret, still will have to disclose the ingredient's chemical family.
In Texas, companies must list the chemicals on a national registry, <a href="http://www.fracfocus.org">Home | FracFocus Chemical Disclosure Registry</a>, beginning Feb. 1.

The Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules yesterday to enforce a law passed by that state's legislature.

Texas will require companies to disclose chemicals but not concentrations. Other states, such as Colorado, require disclosure of concentrations.

Transparency? Really?

Did you forget about the proprietary mixes that the companies WON'T let be made public?

</quote>

I'm interested. Got anything for me to read?

</quote>

Yep. Pay attention to the bolded part where they claim it's a proprietary secret.

And............if the fluid is so safe, why are so many states requiring the following?

</quote>

Thanks for that. Looks like disclosure and transparency to me.
BTW, I didn't use the term "so safe".
I am however still waiting for proof positive that fracking fluids habitually invade fresh water tables during the actual process.

Fracturing isn't a new phenomenon. It's been practiced for over 50 years.
What is relatively new is the absurd fear surrounding it.
And that's probably due to its recent success in unlocking trapped hydrocarbons. There's a boom going on in this country, fracturing jobs have skyrocketed, and more people are becoming aware about it. "Becoming aware" doesn't translate to understanding the entire process.

A positive development is the introduction and/or re-writing of state oil and gas regulations to accomodate this increase in activity. Individual states are capable of implementing such laws without the meddling of the EPA.

Regarding "proprietary mixes", fracking fluids or "slurries" are often customized for each particular job. Companies spend huge sums on research and development and they understandably want to protect their investment. The same can be said for the chemicals involved.

If you come across anything else I'd appreciate you sharing it.

In the West, water is a valued and often rare resource. More fights over water rights than gold. So even a few poisoned aquifers will create a huge resevoir of ill will. It is incumbent on the companies doing the fracking to assess the danger to the aquifers before drilling.

About that study - what the EPA doesn't say is that the US Geological Survey has detected organic chemicals in the well water of Pavillion for at least 50 years.

The dangerous compound the EPA found in drinking water wells was 2-butoxyethyl phosphate, which isn't an oil and gas chemical at all, it's a common fire retardant used in association with plastics and plastic components in drinking water wells.

The pollution detected by the EPA and alleged to be linked to fracking was found in deep-water monitoring wells, not the shallower drinking wells. To the extent that drilling chemicals were found in the deeper monitoring wells, the EPA admits this may result from legacy pits, which are old wellsthat were drilled many years before fracking was used. The EPA also concedes that the inferior design of Pavillion's old wells allows seepage into the water supply. Safer well construction of the kind used today might have prevented any contaminents from leaking into the water supply.

The fracking in Pavillion takes place in unusually shallow wells of fewer than 1000-1500 feet deep. Most fracking today occurs 10,000 feet deep or more, far below normal drinking wells, which typically at 500 feet or less. Even the EPA acknowledges that Pavillion's drilling is far different from other fracking areas. So to imply that this study means that fracking everywhere else is dangerous is spurious.

I wouldn't trust the EPA one bit, obviously they and the Obama admin are in thrall to the greenies.

NY fracking opponents focus efforts on local bans

ALBANY, N.Y. -- As state environmental regulators finish a review of shale gas drilling in New York, opponents of gas well "fracking" are taking a local approach, enacting zoning and planning laws that ban the practice.

This "home rule" tactic will be a focus of environmental groups in the legislative session that begins Wednesday with Gov. Andrew Cuomo's state-of-the-state address.

Sen. James Seward, an Oneonta Republican, is co-sponsoring legislation to give local governments veto power over natural gas drilling. He also wants the Department of Environmental Conservation to address home rule authority in proposed regulations....

Roger that.

I think that state O&amp;G agencies have a decent handle on the issue. There are already a host of regs that dictate fracking practices, fluids containment, and fluids disposal. But with the flurry of activity, we're seeing them revised of late. The sheer volume of newly fractured wells is a bit overwhelming especially in light of state budget cutbacks. DNR offices are swamped.

Illinois may be positioned as a "next frontier" with respect to unconventional gas and oil (requiring fracturing). There's a huge lease grab going on in a select few counties. Our O&amp;G association has been working with other interested parties in writing legislation and we've recently had a bill pass which will subsequently effect our Oil and Gas regs.

It's not really an issue of "if the industry disregards the warnings...", it's about gathering facts and acting upon them through legislation that is responsible to all parties. Industry works in concert with regulatory agencies- not against them.

Don't think for a minute that the fracking companies are not aware of what's going to happen if it can be proved their operations have contaminated drinking water. The lawsuits alone would be enormous, and one can assume that EPA inspectors are vigilant indeed in that regard. As they should be.

I live in farm country, about 60 miles from Youngstown. I grew up here and never felt an earthquake until recently. Now they are becoming frequent. I had no interest in leasing my land to the gas companies. One reason was finding out China just bought a third of Chesapeake Gas. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/> The other is that I already have a gas well, and don't even use it. And the other is environment. I live on a large creek that my ducks, dogs, cat, horses, and chickens drink from daily. It flows through the middle of my property. There are old salt mines right here in my area. Several people have had to drill several times for well water that has no salt in it, me being one of them.
Ohio is floating on liquid gas. Shale is flat thin rock that crumbles easily. My concern is that if you remove the pressure, the shale will collapse, and the land on top of the shale will fall. Another problem is, all of the farms around me have signed up to allow gas drilling. I am literally surrounded by leased property now.
If I don't lease my land to them too, they can sit right on my neighbor's border and suck my gas right out from under me. Even worse they could e-domain me, if I am in their way.
The leasors are offering a shitload of money, that I have already turned down once, but now I am between a thin rock and a hard place. I'm not sure what to do. I could sell/lease my property and move all the animals, but I don't want to. I'll have no choice if they contaminate the creek, but if they ruin the creek then my selling price would plummet. What a mess. I really don't know what to do now.

Well, for starters, it is a good thing you aren't in REAL earthquake country, versus "little" earthquake country. Look what happens in real earthquake country when one hits, right? Versus some window rattling?

You have several alternatives to your problem. One would be to buy up the mineral rights yourself to all neighboring properties and prevent an entire block of acreage from being sold, yourself in the middle, and therefore the best protected from depletion of your resource from adjacent properties.

Another would be to just let them drain your resource from adjacent properties and sue and gum up the works when they try and forcibly unitize your land. You could go postal, or you could just lay back and appreciate how these fractured shales are providing the country with inexpensive and abundant energy, warm in the glow of the good you are contributing to society at large?

And I thought ethanol was supposed to reduce our dependence of foreign energy.
Yet we're exporting 20% of ethanol production.
Go figure.

There's only so much natural gas that you can push to market. At any given time there are massive volumes of nat gas in storage around this country- plenty to meet demand.

Prices are 1/3 what they were just a few years ago and with new discoveries coming online it only makes sense to export it. It creates jobs, economic activity, generates tax revenues, and reduces the trade deficit.

One reason was finding out China just bought a third of Chesapeake Gas. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/> The other is that I already have a gas well, and don't even use it. And the other is environment. I live on a large creek that my ducks, dogs, cat, horses, and chickens drink from daily. It flows through the middle of my property. There are old salt mines right here in my area. Several people have had to drill several times for well water that has no salt in it, me being one of them.
Ohio is floating on liquid gas. Shale is flat thin rock that crumbles easily. My concern is that if you remove the pressure, the shale will collapse, and the land on top of the shale will fall. Another problem is, all of the farms around me have signed up to allow gas drilling. I am literally surrounded by leased property now.
If I don't lease my land to them too, they can sit right on my neighbor's border and suck my gas right out from under me. Even worse they could e-domain me, if I am in their way.
The leasors are offering a shitload of money, that I have already turned down once, but now I am between a thin rock and a hard place. I'm not sure what to do. I could sell/lease my property and move all the animals, but I don't want to. I'll have no choice if they contaminate the creek, but if they ruin the creek then my selling price would plummet. What a mess. I really don't know what to do now.

I'm assuming you've been presented with a lease agreement to review. I'd suggest taking it to an attorney familiar with such documents and who is also well versed in minerals law.

You didn't mention your acreage position (and I'm not asking), but depending on spacing requirements you may be "pooled" with other landowners in which case you'd be sharing revenues on a percentage basis. Your property could be worth much more than just the acres you occupy. Hope that makes sense.

Good luck. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

Have them pay for a water test &amp; get a copy of it, or get one done from the county/state. Make sure your agreement with the gas &amp; drilling company states that if contamination levels rise, they must supply your farm with all the clean water you need for you &amp; the animals. Make sure this supplied water agreement is transferable to future owners of said property. Get the best price you can &amp; take the money before they steal the gas from you. Good Luck.

Locally there are 2 groups of lawyers that have merged to either go after, or to sign you up with, the gas companies that are pouring in. I planned on using an attorney, and will go ahead and let them horizontal drill I think, but they will have to encase both wells and pay for testing of the well water, and the creek water. They have to do that on a regular basis because we need to know if there is a problem before our animals drop dead. I so don't want to move. It's animal heaven here, and I love it. In the middle of the woods on the creek. aahhh.

Fracker are going to wreck this nation's water tables, sell the excess petroeum and gas offshore, pocket the profits, invest them offshore, and leave the American people with the cost of cleanup.

Count on that.

That's quite a combination of preposterous assumptions.

However, you have just described the agriculture industry. LOL

DKC is already building the infrastructure to ship the LPG coming from fracking OUT of the country.

Much of that LPG will be moving out of the nation via SEARPORT MAINE.

And that's a good thing. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

Agreed.

That's going to be a very good thing for those companies who make money selling it.

For the homeowners in Searsport, of course, this project is tragic.

Well to be fair, pretty much everybody in the Penobscot Bay region will be negatively affected by the project if it goes though, but the people whose real estate is closest to the BIG TANK and pumping facility will be most negatively affected.

And I wouldnt actually even mind that, if those cheapskte fucking trillionaires would pay us for the lost value of our homes and lifestyles.

But that they won't do unless they are forced to do so.

Not much chance of that, I expect.

Yeah - it will cost them plenty to supply clean water to all the animals on your property. Make sure the language in the contract does not say you have to prove that the degraded water quality was due to their fracking. That is where they screw a lot of people. Just say if the quality degrades for any reason.

In 2007, major Natural Gas conglomerates began hydrofracking in the Marcellus Shale on the Appalachian Basin. Natural Gas prices were at $ 6-8 at the time.

They bought up land based on valued of natural gas sales expected. When the gas was ultimately pulled from the ground, the prices began to plummet. There was not adequate demand for Natural Gas and the fracking method created a Glut.

Companies recognized that the Marcellus was devoid Liquid Natural Gas (LNG), the Transportation Gas. Its the one that is still highly demanded globally, as 17 countries import the product.

The places in this country it can be found? Most specifically, Texas and also Colorado has rich LNG deposits. However, the Marcellus is a Dead Area.
