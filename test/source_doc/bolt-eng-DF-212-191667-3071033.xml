Thailand in Turmoil

<post author="Merlin" datetime="2009-04-10T00:30:00" id="p1">
Thailand is a popular tourism destination and hailed as 'the land of smiles'. It is a democracy with regular changes in government many of them due to coup.

It is now undergoing political turmoil with tens of thousands out on the street. At the same time, an Asian Summit is being held in a tourist resort.

<quote>
Apr 9, 2009 [ForeignPolicy] Bangkok's streets are again filled with protesters this week in what will likely prove a boisterous but futile attempt to force the government's resignation. But behind all the noise, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who has been directing these demonstrations from outside the country, may well have a more subtle, longer-term agenda.

Thaksin and his supporters have been attacking the country's "aristocracy"--and top adviser to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Prem Tinsulanonda, in particular. This suggests that Thaksin's maneuvers are related less to any effort to immediately oust the current government but instead to undermining the power structures centered around the monarchy, particularly the King's privy council, and the succession process that Thailand will face once ailing King Bhumibol passes from the scene.

The protests are generating more noise than usual thanks to warnings from Thaksin that "the time for talks has passed" and the sense that protesters (known as "red shirts") are pushing for a confrontation. The former prime minister, ousted in a 2006 coup, is still able to create tension in the capital by rallying his supporters from Thailand's northeast and among Bangkok's poor.

But without support from the military, the monarchy, and Bangkok's middle class, these protests are highly unlikely to divide the country's political elite and threaten the current regime. Even Thaksin's allies know that even if they could force new elections, the elite-controlled institutions could undermine their administration. Thaksin is believed to be in either Dubai or Cambodia, and evidence suggests that the military is trying to block his satellite telephone calls to followers inside Thailand....

In short, Thailand is in the midst of a power struggle that could reach deeply into its institutions and power structures. It started with a fight between the elites and Thaksin in 2006, and has begun to spill over into the public sphere. The stakes have been magnified by the uncertainty around the royal succession in a country in which the monarchy remains the most powerful political institution. Thailand's history shows that this type of conflict will take time to resolve, with results ranging from the absurd to the tragic.

Here is a good point by point Q&amp;A analysis of these unrests in Thailand.

<a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE5390HK20090410?pageNumber=3&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0">Q+A - Where is political unrest in Thailand heading?</a>

<quote>
Apr 10, 2009 BANGKOK (Reuters) - Political unrest has returned to Thailand with supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra bringing the capital to a grinding halt.... The "red shirt" Thaksin supporters are demanding the current government step down so new elections can be held and have taken their protests to the southern beach town which is holding an Asia summit this weekend.

WHO'S FIGHTING WHO?

It's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva versus Thaksin, who was removed by the army in a bloodless coup in September 2006 and now lives in self-imposed exile.

The protests are funded and guided from a distance by Thaksin, a former police officer who built up a telecoms empire before turning to politics and becoming prime minister in 2001....

Thaksin funnelled government funds to the poor in the countryside and cities, winning their devotion. But he was also widely seen as authoritarian and critics accused him of corruption. Above all, he was accused of republican leanings in a country that reveres King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

All this set him up for a fight with the royalist elite, the military and the 'old money' business community, and he was ousted in a military coup in September 2006.

Abhisit -- educated at Eton and Oxford and a smooth performer on the international stage -- is much closer to that elite.

He became prime minister in December, taking over from a pro-Thaksin premier,...

WHAT'S THE CHANCE OF THE PROTESTS SPREADING?

Apart from an effort to disrupt a high-profile Asian summit in the seaside town of Pattaya, there has been little echo of the protests outside Bangkok, as Thaksin's allies concentrated their resources on bussing supporters to the capital....

COULD THE PROTESTS TURN VIOLENT?

Abhisit is adamant the government will not crack down, but security forces will take action if the protests turn violent.

Economics Professor Lae Dilokvidhyarat from Chulalongkorn University says Abhisit has learnt a lesson from history.

"History since the 1970s has showed that every civil strife or coup in this country was triggered or stemmed from the government, police or soldiers starting a crackdown," he said.

"History since the 1970s has showed that every civil strife or coup in this country was triggered or stemmed from the government, police or soldiers starting a crackdown," he said....

WILL ALL THIS HURT THE ECONOMY?

The economy is already on the ropes, likely to shrink as much as 4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, because of a slump in exports and the effects of last year's unrest, which hit tourism badly....

It is difficult to know what is the future of Thailand.

Important Asian Summits meetings that were to be held there end of last year had to be postponed more than once. The Summits finally went ahead, but then the most important one involving China, Japan and India had to be cancelled.

Apr 10, 2009 PATTAYA, Thailand (Reuters) - Demonstrators who had vowed to disrupt a regional summit in the beach resort of Pattaya scored a victory on Saturday when the foreign ministers of Japan, South Korea and China were forced to cancel a trilateral meeting.

The protesters, supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blocked the entrance to the meeting venue, and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone was unable to reach it from his nearby hotel, a Japanese foreign ministry official said.

"The trilateral meeting has been canceled," the Japanese foreign ministry official said....

The Chinese and South Korean foreign ministers went ahead with a bilateral meeting.....

The three ministers had been expected to discuss their response to North Korea's recent rocket launch, with Japan and China divided on how to deal with the issue.

A state of emergency has been declared. This may be a mistake. What'll happen next?

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP463929">SNAP ANALYSIS-Thai PM's options narrow after summit fiasco</a>

<quote>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's decision to declare a state of emergency around a cancelled Asian summit has narrowed his options in dealing with anti-government protesters and raises questions about whether he has the backing of the military.

Political developments in the next 48 hours could determine the fate of his four-month-old coalition government.

Here are some possible consequences:

* The degree of enforcement by security forces of the emergency will determine Abhisit's largely untested leadership, and whether he can keep the emboldened, largely rural supporters of exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra under control.

* Abhisit has been considerably weakened by his failure to stop the demonstrators getting anywhere near the summit, which will be interpreted as a sign of indecisiveness even if the aim was to avoid bloodshed.

* Abhisit's gamble on invoking an emergenc risks fomenting widespread civil strife with unpredictable consequences if the military fails to stand firmly behind him.

* Bloodshed following any crackdown on Thaksin's red-shirted supporters will put pressure on Abhisit to step down and call a snap election, or let Thailand's fractious parliament choose a successor.

* Bloodshed could even lead to the military stepping in and mounting another coup, after the one in 2006 that ousted Thaksin, although the army has made it clear repeatedly during months of unrest that it did not want to get involved in politics again....

·A red-shirts leader, who led protesters to disrupt ASEAN summits, has been arrested.
·Arisamun Pongruangrong is detained at the Border Patrol Police headquarters.
·Thai Prime Minister vowed Sunday he would punish those responsible for disruption.

BANGKOK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Thai red-shirts leaders claimed that Arisamun Pongruangrong, who led protesters to disrupt the ASEAN summits due to be held in Pattaya, Thailand Saturday, has been arrested, according to The Nation's website Sunday.

Bangkok police later confirmed Arisamun has been arrested for inciting protesters disrupting the summits and violating the Constitution.

It is a great pity a few of these Asian summit meetings had to be postponed. Here is a $10 billion reason.

<quote>
Apr 12, 2009 BEIJING (Reuters) - China had planned to announce a $10 billion (6.8 billion pound) infrastructure investment fund and offer credit to neighbours at a cancelled weekend summit of Asian leaders in Thailand, its foreign minister said.

Anti-government protestors forced the cancellation of the summit in Pattaya after they swarmed into the summit venue.

In an interview with state media on a flight back to China, Foreign minister Yang Jiechi avoided direct criticism of the Thai government while detailing measures that Chinese premier Wen Jiabao had planned to offer at the summit.

China plans to establish a $10 billion China-ASEAN investment cooperation fund to promote infrastructure that connects it to ASEAN nations, Yang said.

China has been active in building roads from its southern border through neighbouring Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, to ease trade.

It will also offer a credit of $15 billion to ASEAN countries, including preferential loans of $1.7 billion for cooperation projects, Yang said.....

While not an ASEAN member, China's growing economic clout, huge market and competitive exports make it an important participant in ASEAN summits,...

China recently appointed its first ambassador to ASEAN, after the 10-member grouping formally adopted a charter.

The turmoil in Thailand is getting worse. A state of emergency has been declared in and around Bangkok. The army has been mobilised, tanks are on the street, and the situation is getting more violent. The PM refused to resign. The previously disposed and self-exciled PM Thaksin said he may return to Thailand. Travel advisory has been issued by a number of countries.

Ir is not possible to know what will be the outcome.

<a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/13/content_11180927.htm">Violence escalates in Thailand</a>

<quote>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Violence in Thailand is escalating Monday despite government troops attempted to gain control and restore order to the capital Bangkok.

The whole-day's stand-off and clashes between anti-government "red shirted" protestors and Thai police and soldiers have left more than 70 people injured.

A building in Thailand's education ministry complex has been set ablaze after being hit by petrol bombs. Protestors also seized seven buses and set them on fire in front of the army headquarters, sending flames shooting high into the sky, witnesses said.

Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said on national TV that the protestors had no right to break the law or violate other people's rights. He added that he would not step down under violence threat.

Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban also warned of possible sabotage of "red shirted" people on Monday night.

In a televised program, Suthep, who is in charge of national security, asked police and soldiers to take action against protesters who break the law.....

The violence started before dawn Monday after Abhisit declared a state of emergency on Sunday afternoon in Bangkok and some districts of five provinces nearby, citing the escalating violence of red-shirted protesters.

Soon after the declaration of the state of emergency, soldiers and armored carriers were deployed onto the Bangkok street.

At about 4:30 a.m. local time Monday morning, some 300 red-shirted protestors used a seized bus to crash soldiers stationed at Din Daeng District in north Bangkok. Soldiers fired warning shots into the air and used teargas to disperse the protestors....

I generally agree with the views here.

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123975933750419419.html">Thailand Needs New Elections</a>

<quote>
Apr 15, 2009 [WSJ] Over the past few years, Thailand's political elites have waged a battle on the streets of the capital using mobs to throw democratically elected governments out of power. Now it is the turn of the supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra, the deposed former prime minister, to wreak their revenge. Meanwhile the economic losses mount, and one of Asia's oldest democracies looks more and more fragile. So where did Thailand go wrong?

For decades, power-brokers in the military, parliament and boardroom used the government to enrich themselves. The populist Mr. Thaksin threatened their interests by obtaining a strong democratic mandate to start expensive government programs to benefit the rural poor, and also to open the door wider to the forces of globalization and competition. Last weekend's riots by the "Red Shirts," Mr. Thaksin's supporters, mimicked the tactics used by the anti-Thaksin forces, the "Yellow Shirts," in late 2008. That group also surrounded government buildings and blockaded Bangkok's airports for days, bringing the country to a virtual standstill.

Both protests reflect an increasingly polarized Thai society. On the Yellow side are monarchists who profess loyalty to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the army, many academics, some of the business elite, and ordinary Thais mainly from the southern provinces. On the Red side are supporters of Mr. Thaksin, including business owners who benefited under his rule, and many rural voters especially in the north and northeast of the country who also reaped the rewards of his populist "Thaksinomics."

The Reds have the advantage of sheer numbers, and most probably free and fair elections would return pro-Thaksin forces to leadership. The Yellows claim legitimacy because of their loyalty to the king; they also have the army and, for the most part, the police force behind them. In the middle are large numbers of ordinary Thais who want to get back to stability and prosperity.

Full rehabilitation of Mr. Thaksin most probably would require a pardon, whether by the king or the parliament. Yet there are other steps that could be taken -- and that don't necessarily need to factor in Mr. Thaksin directly -- that also might pave the way for meaningful reconciliation.

The government could grant amnesty to the 111 members of Mr. Thaksin's now-defunct Thai Rak Thai Party, allowing them to re-enter the political arena. This group, including Mr. Thaksin, was banned from politics for five years by a junta-appointed panel for breaking electoral laws prior to the parliamentary elections of April 2, 2006.

The current Constitution of 2007 could be amended to reflect better the so-called People's Constitution of 1997. Many consider this Constitution the most democratic in the country's history, not least because it was drawn up with extensive public consultation, and for the first time called for direct elections to both the upper and lower houses of parliament. In any case, greater power needs to be returned to the elected members of parliament and removed from nonelected institutions and representatives of the state. Some of the reforms of the 1997 Constitution were rolled back in 2007.

More importantly, there should be fresh elections as soon as possible. By hanging on to power until the bitter end, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and his coalition government risk doing more harm than good. The prime minister should recognize that the current situation is untenable.....

<quote>
Apr 19, 2009 BANGKOK, THAILAND  The charred buses and metal barricades are gone. Armed soldiers still patrol the capital, but discretely. Even the traffic is back to its usual near-gridlock.

But one week after Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejajjiva declared a state of emergency to put down violent protests here by red-shirted opponents, who sought his resignation, the shock waves are still rippling through a polarized, shaken nation.

The emergency laws were reaffirmed Sunday after a meeting between security officials and the prime minister. It may be several days before its lifted. Police are hunting for the gunmen behind the shooting on Friday of Sondhi Limthongkul, a leader of a rival protest group, known as yellow shirts.

Authorities have separately detained 34 people over the recent protests and closed down opposition radio stations and Internet sites blamed for inciting violence.

Beyond the immediate security threat, however, lies a more complex challenge: restoring faith in Thailands fragile democracy to solve its grinding political conflict. If this fails, the outcome could be more turmoil and greater instability, say political analysts and politicians.

FRESH ELECTIONS?
Much of the debate centers on proposed changes to a 2007 constitution and a possible amnesty for banned politicians, followed by fresh elections. There is deep disquiet over the role of powerful elites, including the military, in the process, as well as the risk of a popular backlash to any poll results.

Mr. Abhisit, who took power in December after a court disbanded three parties in the previous coalition government, has promised to hold elections, once political reforms are concluded. But he hasnt laid out a firm timetable for the reforms, which experts have said could take several months to finalize.....

<quote>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva lifted a state of emergency in Bangkok on Friday and promised constitutional reforms in the latest bid to resolve the country's long-running political crisis.

Abhisit announced the decision in parliament after a late-night debate on violent anti-government street protests and officials said the decree would be formally lifted later on Friday.

"The official end of the decree has to be published in the Royal Gazette, which officers are working on right now," Satit Wonghnongtaey, a minister of the prime minister's office, told Reuters.

Emergency rule was imposed in the capital and surrounding areas 12 days ago to quell violent street protests involving thousands of demonstrators intent on toppling the government.

Two people were killed and more than 100 injured in the worst street violence in 16 years, threatening further damage to the key tourist industry and Thailand's recession-bound economy....

The emergency measures barely affected daily life in the city of over 10 million people. Abhisit said protests could resume as long as they were peaceful.....

Abhisit, who has previously rejected a new poll, proposed a new commission to study amendments to the 2007 constitution, which was drafted by a military-installed government after Thaksin was removed in a coup a year earlier....

Critics have said the constitution was a step back from the 1997 "People's Charter", which allowed for a fully elected upper house.

Thailand's political trouble has calmed down, but it can flare up again. But as it holds the rotating chair of the 10-nation Association Asean until the end of 2009, it still has an obligation to host the postponed Asean summit.

BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's government Monday said it will propose to other ASEAN leaders and dialogue partner leaders to host the ASEAN Summit and Related Summits during June 13-14 in Thailand's southern province of Phuket.

The proposed date of the summit in June is not finalized since many leaders have not yet confirmed,...

As the Thai government has guaranteed the full safety, however, Deputy Prime Minister Suthep declined to commit whether the safety arrangement would meet the international standard.

Suthep added that local residents in Phuket would not hold any protest against the summit.

The 14th ASEAN Summit and Related Summits were initially scheduled to be held on April 10-12 in a hotel in Thai resort town of Pattaya and the Thai government announced the postponement of it on April 11 after anti-government-red-shirted protestors stormed into the venue.

<quote>
27 May [GMANews] YALA, Thailand  A series of bomb and arson attacks believed to have been carried out by Muslim insurgents rocked a provincial capital in southern Thailand early Wednesday, police said.

The attacks, beginning before dawn, were staged at eight locations across the capital of Yala, said police Col. Ekarit Wiriyapap. Yala is one of three provinces in the country's deep south hit by a separatist insurgency that has killed more than 3,400 people since 2004.

No casualties were reported but there was extensive property damage, Ekarit told reporters.....

"The attacks did not aim to kill anyone but rather to cause chaos and intimidate people in the area because there were no people at the time and location of the attacks," he said.

A pro-independence movement has long existed in the predominantly Muslim provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat. It turned violent in 2004 after a period of relative peace.

Many Muslims feel they have been treated as second-class citizens in a country dominated by Buddhists, but only a few thousand are thought to have taken up arms.

2004 was Thaksin's time as PM. He had been effective crushing by force the criminal gangs in the capital Bangkok. I understand when dealing with these Muslim separatist movements, he used the same military method. But it didn't work well as he didn't realize this is different and has to be handled with both military and civil methods.

His armed force made worse mistake about 18 months ago when after rounding up these Muslims, many of them suffocated and died inside closed containers.

I don't know if the present PM Abhasit is better or worse handling these separatist movements.

This attack in a mosque in S Thailand is one of the most deadly.

<quote>
6 hrs ago PATTANI, Thailand (AP)  Gunmen opened fire on a mosque in southern Thailand during evening prayers Monday, killing at least 10 people and wounding another 19 in the violence-plagued region, police said.

The attack was one of the most deadly single incidents since an Islamic separatist insurgency was launched in Thailand's three southernmost provinces in early 2004. More than 3,400 people have been killed in the violence, most victims of the insurgents.

Five or six men shot automatic rifles into the mosque in Narathiwat province's Joh-I-Rong district on Monday, said police Lt. Col. Somjai Singkliang.

However, the Web site of the newspaper The Nation cited Army spokesman Col. Parinya Chaidilok as saying there were only two attackers. The newspaper also reported that an 11th person had died en route to hospital.

Among those who died at the mosque was the Imam, or prayer leader, said Somjai, who added that most of the 19 people wounded in the attack were in serious condition.

Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala provinces, where virtually all the violence has occurred, are the only Muslim-majority provinces in predominantly Buddhist Thailand. Southern Muslims have long complained of discrimination, especially in education and job opportunities.

Last week two teachers, one eight months pregnant, were killed in the same province in an attack attributed to the insurgents. The deaths triggered intense anger among the area's Buddhist community....

Focus on education, employment and economy to bring peace to Thai south

9 June PUTRAJAYA - MALAYSIA has agreed to help Thailand revamp the curriculum of its Islamic schools, as part of a bid to end the Muslim insurgency in its neighbour's violence-wracked south.
Prime Minister Najib Razak, speaking after his Thai counterpart Abhisit Vejjajiva's first official visit to Malaysia yesterday, said both countries believed they could resolve the decades-old unrest through the 'Three Es': education, employment, economy.

'We remain optimistic that things can get a lot better if we continue to focus on...giving them a better future,' he said at a press conference with Mr Abhisit.

The Thai Premier led a team of 38 officials, including his deputy Suthep Thaugsuban and Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya.

The two leaders discussed steps to develop the economy in southern Thailand, as well as Malaysia's contribution in providing scholarships and vocational training for Thai-Muslim students.

Buddhist-majority Thailand annexed the former ethnic-Malay sultanate in 1902, leading to decades of tension which exploded in renewed violence in 2004.

More than 3,400 people have been killed so far in Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, where residents are more fluent in a Malay dialect than they are in Thai, and live in one of Thailand's poorest areas.

The region remains under martial law and sporadic violence has continued, with suspected militant gunmen killing 10 worshippers and wounding 13 in a mosque late on Monday, although Bangkok's counterinsurgency effort has managed to reduce the attacks......

Merlin,

As I recall Thaksin's mishandling of the insurgency was one of the reasons the Army cited for originally removing him. While I'm sure this was only partly true, they seem to have done a better job since. I understand terrorist attacks have been down &amp; local moderates have been brought onside with the government..

On a related question, have you heard any more about who was responsible fo the massacre in the mosque? I suppose the two possibilities are radical islamists or some sort of government-aligned death squad. If it is the latter this will be a disaster far bigger than the current death toll.

Tankie,

The 'kill 'em all &amp; let God sort 'em out' approach feels good, but in these sort of situations it is counterproductive. When the previous government tried it it just made things worse. A more nuanced approach has actually worked (as it did in Iraq &amp; countless other instances.) Shooting up a mosque is a guaranteed way to p1ss people off. That is why I'm hoping it is Islamist crazies trying to make some point. If so, they cut their own throats. if it has a government connection years of good work go in one day.

I also love Thailand &amp; its people, but don't buy too heavily into the 'land of smiles' bit. It can suck to be an ethnic minority there as millions if Issan &amp; Khmer could tell you. Nothing justifies the behaviour of the islamist gunmen in the Sth, but they feed off genuine grievances among the Malay population. As the government dealt with the grievances so the terrorism dropped off.

Its not about stiff upper lip mate, its about using our heads. It isn't about appeasing terrorists, its about taking away their support base &amp; leaving them high &amp; dry. I understand the frustration, but I also understand that by giving in to it we do exactly what they want us to. Before we can kill them we have to isolate them

Also remember that the people in that mosque were likely no more guilty of anything than the people in the twin towers. Kuku is on the money, violence out of anger just kills the wrong people &amp; helps the wrong people.

Yes B\F i take your point, but maybe they were as guilty as sin and deserved it. But im glad to see the ordinary man in the street sticking up against them and fighting back, no doubt there will be retaliation and that will escalate, but how to stop them <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/confused.gif"/> its been going on for donkies years and at last someone is playing by their rules and dishing it back, if they were innocent, well maybe the ordinary muslim law abiding ones may turn against the crap ones and get rid of them, i certainly hope so

Tankie,

Latest reports suggest that the gunmen you were cheering were actually Islamic Radicals attacking moderate muslims who don't share their vision of a revolutionary Wahabi Caliphate. More innocent victims.

As more than one person has observed, this is an international Islamic civil war into which we waded before we even knew it was happening. Now most sides use the West for their own ends. One lot tries to get us to use our momey &amp; military power to help them. The other tries to get us to misuse our military power to help them. (most just want everyone to leave them the hell alone, but no one listens to them).

It is too early to know for sure who are the attackers at this S Thailand Mosque. This Reuters news source suspect they are likely the 'separatist or ethno-nationalist', although in other violent incidents, 'extrajudicial killings by security forces, and drug and mafia-related murders are rife'.

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSBKK463005">Q+A-Thailand's shadowy southern insurgency</a>

<quote>
BANGKOK June 9 (Reuters) - Thailand's deep south has been hit by its worst violence in months, culminating in Monday's bloody attack on a mosque where gunmen killed 10 Muslims as they prayed.

Nineteen people have been killed and 40 injured since Friday in three predominately Muslim provinces near the Malaysian border where nearly 3,500 people have died in violence since 2004. [ID:nL81020018]

Despite more than 30,000 troops in the region, Thailand is no closer to quelling a shadowy insurgency.

WHO IS BEHIND THE VIOLENCE?

No credible group has claimed responsibility for any of the attacks, but analysts say the rebels' motivation is most likely separatist or ethno-nationalist.

The provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani were once an independent Malay-Muslim sultanate annexed by Buddhist Thailand a century ago.

Southern Muslims have resisted policies of assimilation by successive Thai governments. Many feel their language, culture and ethnicity is not properly recognised by Thais.

Authorities usually blame insurgents for the violence but rights groups have documented extrajudicial killings by security forces, and drug and mafia-related murders are rife....

YALA, Thailand, June 10 (Reuters) - A Buddhist construction worker was shot dead and two others wounded in Thailand's restive deep south on Wednesday as tensions escalated in the wake of a bloody attack on a mosque.

Police said four gunmen on motorcycles opened fire on labourers at a construction site, killing one woman and wounding two men in Yala, one of three violence-plagued provinces near the Malaysian border.

A note left at the scene said: "You kill our innocents, so we kill your people."

The shooting followed Monday's brazen attack on a mosque in Narathiwat, where 10 Muslims were killed and 12 wounded in one of the deadliest incidents this year in the deep south, where nearly 3,500 people have died in violence since 2004.....

Sorry Tankie, I was watching the news when I typed. Thanks to Merlin for supplying some more detailed info.

A few points from all this. First, in one sense it doesn't matter to me who did this. I'd feel the same way if it were a church or temple. The overwhelming majority of people in this world, muslims included, are effectively 'innocents'.

As I said, the only reason it matters to me who did it is the potential fallout in Thailand. Based on past experience &amp; distrust some muslims will simply assume it was government related. If it wasn't that will hopefully limit the damage.

Second point: I probably should have thrown this in before, but the 'just want to be left alone' are actually the most important people in all this. The are the overwhelming majority and they are up for grabs. These are really the people we are all fighting over. They are the ones the rhetoric is aimed at, the aid etc. Groups like AQ are hoping that the mistakes of their enemies will push these people into supporting extremists where their own limited ability to persuade fails.

Final: I think there is a chance for a moment of insight here. Don't take this the wrong way, I wouldn't say it if I didn't respect you.

I understand your anger &amp; I think I understand its roots. You have seen acts of terrorism by muslims at home &amp; overseas. Terrible things. Perhaps you have seen other muslims rationalize &amp; support these terrible acts. It has made you angry. Perhaps angry enough to cheer when a dozen (most likely innocent) muslims are slaughtered. How did I do? <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

Take a different perspective for a moment. Imagine that you are not Tankie but Tariq. Same age, same education, perhaps even ex-military. In some ways very similar. Chances are you live or have lived most of your life with few political freedoms. Chances are that for at least some of that time the government doing the oppressing was supported by a Western power (perhaps more than one). You have seen terrible things too. Things you consider terrorism. Things done by Western powers or their supporters. Acts that have taken many more muslim lives than any number of westerners killed by muslims. You have seen Westerners rationalize &amp; support these acts. It has made you angry. Angry enough to cheer next time a sucide bomber attacks a 'western target'.

My point here is that the anger, however justifiable, is wrong. Good people on all sides of this can find reasons why it is acceptable to take extreme positions. Yet they are the very people who need to fight those temptations. The bad ones have already stopped. The more people who support or excuse the extremes the harder it will be to win this damned struggle &amp; devote our collective energies to something more positive. Don't give in to the dark side Tankie. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

Hmm ok B/F i take your points, however i have put in bold in your post the points i will take up with you,

1stly, its always the innocents or nearly always ? except when some of them have crawled out from under their stones and been caught ?these are the ones to be exterminated, and their followers know who and where they are,,DEAL WITH THEM, or more innocents will be killed they who are in the firing line, thats why i get angry, they are soft targets, who are living there lives getting caught up in this terrorism, they are someones mothers / fathers / children / and they could have been mine, or yours, blown to bits

FOR WHAT END,

I understand what you say B/F, and also i know it takes 2 to tango, ref western gov ? however IMO,its time to stand up to these bastards and fight back, because the democratic free <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/rolleyes.gif"/> world does not want radicalising or Islam, some christians have converted i know, well if thats what they want and choose, well good for them, thats their choice, i choose neither of them i will stay an agnostic.The muslims killed in Thailand,if they were innocents and just getting on with their lives,well as i have said they have my sympathies, when i read the story it implied that Thai people were getting there own back and i assumed that they had found out who were behind the killings of Thai,s, thats why i was :cheering: and i will cheer again if people around the world fight back and destroy those vermin.And i would hope that millons of ordinary Muslims would do the same.

2nd point

Guess what, i want to be left alone and so do millions of others, just to live our lives in peace and not have some lame brained preaching bastard getting numb headed no future suicide bombers to do their bidding, in the name of religeon.Religeon IMO,its B/S.Yes B/F i get angry, very angry,its justifiable anger. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/mad.gif"/>

However i will wait and see how Obamas speech will be taken by them.I dont think a blind bit of notice will be, they will see it as a weakness and and expoilation will be the end result methinks.

I also respect your point of view mate, was it not your PM, cant remember his name who said,, if muslims want to live here,then live by our rules, if not go to a country that supports your views, ie, sharia law, i was very impressed with that,, then we get to the Archbishop of Canterbury who sprouts off about there could be a place for sharia law in The UK, why do these arseholes not keep out of it the fungus faced tosser, an appeaser, thats what he is, same as the spineless govt the UK has.

And then we come to the human rights malarky where we cant secretly investigate suspect terrorist, hahahahahaha well blow me down,, oops no dont take that seriously Mr Hamza, its all appeasement mate, they dont want democracy, they use it tho, but dont want it, im all for the populace fighting back B/F.And i hope ( but wont hold my breath ) that the law abiding ordinary muslims are the ones who will break the stranglehold of radical Islamists, because if not, sadly, more innocent people will be killed.

PS you did good <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/> but i have a Q for you, how do you think the issue should be challenged.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A moderate Muslim cleric who denounced suicide attacks as forbidden by Islam was killed Friday in a suicide attack on his mosque in Lahore, authorities said.

A Pakistani rescue worker works outside a damaged room of Jamia Naimia religious school.

Sarfraz Ahmed Naeemi was the first imam in Pakistan to issue a fatwa, or religious edict, against suicide attacks in Pakistan.

On Friday, a suicide bomber approached Naeemi as he left the Jamia Naimia Mosque and religious school. The bomber detonated his explosives, killing Naeemi and two others, police said. Another 10 people were wounded in the attack.

Naeemi had recently received death threats because of his opposition to the Taliban and his support of the current Pakistani military offensive against Taliban militants, his son told local television.

It was one of two mosque bombings in Pakistan on Friday, which has suffered a series of attacks in the wake of its ongoing military campaign

<quote>
5 hrs ago YALA, Thailand (AFP) — Suspected Muslim militants decapitated a rubber-tapper and displayed his head on a stick outside his house in the latest violence in Thailand's troubled south, police said Monday.

The attack comes amid a recent spike in bloodshed in the restive Muslim-majority region bordering Malaysia, where more than 3,700 people have been killed during a bitter five-year insurgency.

Police said the 53-year-old victim's body was found with the head, hands and lower legs removed at his makeshift house on a rubber plantation in volatile Yala province on Monday morning.

The attackers stuck his head on a stick and put it in front of the building, they said.

In neighbouring Narathiwat province, a suspected insurgent gunman riding a motorcycle shot dead a Muslim man in front of his house, also on Monday, police said.

Meanwhile a bomb hidden inside a motorcycle and triggered by mobile phone exploded in Narathiwat on Sunday evening, injuring ten people who were shopping at a weekend market, they added.

Thailand's government is struggling to curb the sudden upsurge in violence in the south that erupted in recent weeks, including a bloody attack on a mosque in which gunmen shot dead 11 people during evening prayers.

The insurgents have in the past targeted both security forces and civilians -- Buddhist and Muslim alike -- ranging from teachers to rubber plantation workers.....

<quote>
5 hrs ago BANGKOK (AP)  Ten Muslim villagers killed by gunmen firing assault rifles into a mosque during evening prayers. A 53-year-old Buddhist rubber tapper shot, decapitated and limbs cut from his torso, his head impaled on a stick.

The circumstances and brutality of those attacks this month have revived fears that a long-running insurgency in Thailand's south could be evolving into a sectarian conflict pitting Buddhists against Muslims.

Islamic separatists ignited the insurgency in January 2004, sparking a cycle of army repression and rebellion that has left more than 3,500 people dead. Frustrated by their inability to curb the violence, Thai security forces have increasingly been arming civilian self-defense forces  almost all Buddhist  to protect villagers.

The proliferation of guns, many put in the poorly trained hands of parties with scores to settle, makes the situation extremely volatile.

The June 8 attack on the Al Furqan mosque in Narathiwat province's Joh-I-Rong district and its aftermath suggest such initiatives may have backfired.
..
With cold deliberation, five or six masked gunmen dressed in black poured fire into the mosque, which serves a community that had avoided the deadly tumult of recent years....

Many local Muslims believe the mosque massacre was revenge for the killing of a young Buddhist rubber plantation worker in a nearby district earlier that day....

<quote>
June 27 (Bloomberg) -- Thai anti-government protesters who support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra plan to meet in Bangkok today in what organizers say will be the largest rally since the army quelled riots by the group in April.

The demonstrators, who say the constitution gives too much power to judges, bureaucrats and royal advisers at the expense of elected politicians, will meet throughout the night and leave in the early morning hours, Jatuporn Prompan, a protest leader, said by telephone. The rally should be peaceful unless security forces attempt to disperse the group, he said....

The protest may pressure Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to hasten plans to amend the constitution as a reconciliation panel gets ready to propose changes next month. The protesters say Abhisit is illegitimate because he came to power after a court dissolved the former pro-Thaksin ruling party.

Thailands political turmoil has weighed on the benchmark SET index, which is trading at 11 times estimated earnings for this year, the second-lowest in Asia after Pakistan. The index, up 35 percent so far this year, remains 24 percent below its level a year ago.....

Abhisit imposed a state of emergency for 12 days in April after protesters backed by Thaksin forced the cancellation of an Asian summit, clogged up traffic and set fires around the capital. Soldiers used tear gas to disperse them, leading to clashes that left at least two dead and more than 100 injured.....

BANGKOK, June 27 (Reuters) - Thousands of "red shirt" supporters of ousted Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra rallied in Bangkok on Saturday in their biggest protest since sparking violent clashes two months ago.

The United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), better known as the "red shirts", gathered in the capital to demand that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolves parliament and calls an election.

Six hundred police were on duty and hundreds more on standby at Sanam Luang, a public square near Bangkok's Grand Palace.

The exiled Thaksin, who was blamed for instigating riots by "red shirt" demonstrators in April, addressed the crowd by telephone and accused Abhisit's government of mismanaging the economy, raising taxes and plunging the poor into debt.

He pledged his loyalty to his supporters and called for all Thais to put aside their differences.

About 20,000 protesters braved the pouring rain to listen to the hour-long address by the former telecoms tycoon, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and fled Thailand last year to avoid a two-year jail sentence for graft....

The source said a key member of JI believed to be linked to the July 17 bombings of the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta was providing the southern militants with the bomb-making training.

He also said radios, rather than mobile phones, were being used to detonate bombs - a method devised to avoid detection by authorities' efforts to track phone signals.

Southern insurgents have embraced transceiver technology in their bomb attacks, a technique found to be common in the Iraq war.

Radio transceivers are known to have triggered recent bombings in the far South. They make for a more efficient trigger device than mobile phones because authorities cannot interfere with the signals....

<a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/31/content_11806794.htm">Thailand's political uncertainty may prolong economic slump</a>

<quote>
BANGKOK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- As the anti-government group gathered Friday in Thailand, the country's business sector worries that the political uncertainty may prolong the domestic economic downturn.

The United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) group held a mass rally here as the last day of a signature campaign to support a royal pardon to be sought for ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

The UDD group, which is also known as the red-shirted people, were rallying at Sanam Luang, the royal field square, in the center of capital Bangkok.

They plan to submit the pardon petition with at least a million names of people for Thaksin to the Office of His Majesty's Principal Private Secretary, probably on Aug. 7.

Thaksin was ousted by the military coup in September, 2006, in accusation of corruption, and has been kept in exile since then. Thaksin returned to Thailand in February last year to face corruption charges, but he later fled into exile again and was convicted in absentia.

The re-gathering by Thaksin's supporters is jittering several groups in the Thai society since the country's recent political chaos, which caused by the red-shirted people, resulted in the collapse of the ASEAN Summit and its related meetings in Thailand in mid-April.

Hence, during the first half of this year, the Japanese business sentiment towards Thailand deteriorated, according to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce (JCC), the Bangkok Post reported on Friday.

Japanese investors are the most active foreign investors in Thailand as their direct investments have largely contributed to Thailand's economic development.

The political crisis from April to May, which had affected sale revenues of a Thai leading direct sales company, Giffarine Skyline Unity Co, supports the JCC view.

Giffarine Skyline Unity said its sales in the first seven months of this year rose only 8 percent to 2.4 billion baht (70.5 million U.S. dollars), below its previous projection of 10 percent to 15 percent.

The recent political crisis had also largely affected the domestic tourism industry as the number of foreign tourists booking through travel agents during the first half of this year plunged by 38 percent to 867,267 year-on-year, the Association of Thai Travel Agents said on Thursday.

Moreover, the JCC said most Japanese investors have remained worried about Thailand's ongoing political turmoil, amid the continued impact of the world economic crisis.

In a recent survey among 1,291 members by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce from May 26 to June 26, it was discovered that the potential factors, which would affect the Thai economy over the next one to two years, include the domestic long-term political turmoil.

The Japanese Chamber of Commerce has conducted the biannual Japanese business sentiment in Thailand survey for 25 years as the latest survey was released on Thursday by the JCC......

But, currently Japanese companies in Thailand have to report the Thai political situation more often to their head offices, and this has probably affected their decision-making on new investments here, Yamada said.

Yamada also confirms some Japanese companies have already deferred new investment, or deferred investment for expansion, therefore he has warned that any prolonged political turmoil might eventually affect Japanese investments in Thailand.

Meanwhile, former Thai finance minister Virabongsa Ramangkura on Friday has echoed the JCC view as he has doubted over the Thai economic recovery....

Another protest from Thanksin's supporters.

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE57G0V520090817">Thai "red shirts" rally, seek pardon for Thaksin</a>

<quote>
17 Aug BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than 20,000 supporters of former Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra rallied in the historic heart of Bangkok on Monday, seeking a royal pardon for the fugitive billionaire and illustrating a deep political divide.

Officials from the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship, known as the "red shirts," plan to give hundreds of boxes containing details of five million signatures to a representative of the king at the gate of Bangkok's Grand Palace....

Monday's rally was the latest big show of support for Thaksin since April, when the Thai military was brought in to end violent anti-government protests, demonstrating that his followers are steadily rebuilding momentum.

The demonstrators dispersed peacefully in April but vowed to keep up pressure to force Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to resign.

The petition asked 81-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej to allow Thaksin to return from exile a free man. Legal experts said there was little chance he would receive a pardon. Royalists said it had to be submitted in person or by a family member.

King Bhumibol, the world's longest-reigning monarch, is officially above politics but has intervened at times of crisis.

INVESTORS MONITOR UNREST
While the sight of thousands of protesters in a grassy square in front of the Grand Palace will probably add to the unease of tourists, a pillar of the Thai economy, investors in local stocks took solace at the lack of violence on Monday morning.....

But the rallies complicate the Oxford-educated Abhisit's efforts to end Thailand's first recession in a decade, underlining the difficulty of uniting a deeply polarized country and a fragile six-party coalition government.

The petition has outraged powerful royalists who support Abhisit and accuse Thaksin and his backers of insulting the revered monarch by trying to drag him into a political dispute.

Most commentators say the motive behind the petition is to highlight Thaksin's mass support and keep his movement alive.

Thaksin won landslide election victories in 2001 and 2005. He was found guilty of corruption last October and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison. He denies the charges and still commands a loyal following, especially among the poor in vote-rich rural areas.

To ASEAN, this summit is important. Thailand being the current chair, has to host it. It had to be cancelled once when protesters disrupted it. The alternate venue was announced by the FM, and now the PM said it still has not been decided.

<a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsworld.php?id=433118">ASEAN Summit Venue To Be Announced Next Week</a>
BANGKOK, Aug 15 (Bernama) -- Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Saturday that the exact venue of the 15th ASEAN summit should be known next week, Thailand News Agency (TNA) reported.

His remarks were made only a day after Foreign Affairs Minister Kasit Piromya said that the venue of the summit had been changed from the southern resort island of Phuket to the seaside resort towns of Cha-am and Hua Hin southwest of Bangkok, but the summit would take place October 23-25 as originally planned.

Abhisit, however, said the exact venue of the summit is still not decided and said that concerned officials are considering several factors before making the final decision.

The prime minister said it might be "inconvenient" to hold the summit in Phuket as the community will hold its annual vegetarian fair, and that the necessary security arrangement could negatively impact tourism at that time.

He said the venue of the summit should be announced at a meeting next week while the meeting dates remain unchanged.

Thailand need to sort out its own unending problems to avoid instability and economic uncertainty.

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125093437287751395.html">Thailand's King Calls for Unity</a>

<quote>
22 Aug [WSJ] BANGKOK  Thailand's widely respected king made a rare foray into the country's long-running political problems, warning that Thailand could become increasingly unstable if its feuding politicians fail to unite, media reports here said Saturday.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 81, offered the remarks at an audience at a seaside palace late Friday night as worries grew about the durability of the current government led by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. His words were later broadcast on national television and reported by Thai media.....

Thailand, one of the largest economies in Southeast Asia and a major production hub for companies such as Toyota Motor Co., has lurched from crisis to crisis since a military coup unseated former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in September 2006.

Yellow-wearing royalists helped pave the way for the ouster, accusing the former telecommunications magnate of using dictatorial powers to sidestep the country's parliamentary system of checks and balances. Last year, yellow-clad protesters invaded and closed Bangkok's international airports in a successful attempt to force the collapse of a pro-Thaksin government.

Mr. Thaksin's supporters, meanwhile, took up red as their color and have demanded greater democracy and less military influence in Thailand. Last week 20,000 of them gathered outside Bangkok's Grand Palace to submit a 3.5 million-name petition seeking a royal pardon for Mr. Thaksin, who is currently living abroad to avoid imprisonment for a corruption conviction.

Economists worry the continuing tension could derail a possible economic recovery in Thailand as its neighbors begin to bounce back from the global financial crisis. At the moment, the government expects the Thai economy to contract 3.5% this year before expanding in 2010.

In addition, concern is growing that Thailand's current leader  the Oxford-trained economist Mr. Abhisit  is losing control of the fragile, military-backed coalition which came to power last December. Thai police officials last week refused to accept his nomination for a new national police chief, raising speculation that Mr. Abhisit main soon dissolve parliament and call fresh elections.....

BANGKOK, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said on Monday that he will not cling to his post as party leader and was ready for, if any, political changes, including party dissolution.

Thai language news agency Matichon Online quoted the premier assaying this at Government House to a group of politicians who was attending a training course on political development.

When asked what if the Democrat Party, of which he is a leader, is dissolved, Abhisit said even though he might become the opposition leader, or the Democrat Party might want to change the leader in the future, he will continue his MP status only with the Democrat Party until he stops his political career.

The question was raised by a member of the opposition party as Abhisit's party, which serves as the biggest ruling party in the coalition government, faced a possibility of dissolution.

The Democrat party was accused of illegally receiving a donation of baht 258 million (7.58 million U.S. dollars) from a listed company and had abused the Election Commission's (EC) party development fund worth baht 29 million (0.85 million U.S. dollars).

Thaksin in excile can still rally his red shirt supporters for a rally on Sunday. PM Abhisit gets the support from the elite, but cannot win over the rural poor majority.

The investors are of course not happy with uncertainty of instability.

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSBKK475651">ANALYSIS-Thaksin's rallies signal trouble for Thai rulers</a>

<quote>
BANGKOK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Former Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra is showing he can still whip up supporters and flex his political muscle while in exile, signalling trouble ahead for Thailand's fragile ruling coalition and chronic political crisis.

Plans for thousands of the fugitive billionaire's red-shirted supporters to rally on Sunday are a reminder of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's failure to overcome Thailand's deep political divisions -- and of the potential for further instability after violent anti-government riots in April.

By putting down April's protests, the armed forces were believed to have crushed the dreams of a political comback for the populist Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and now lives in self-imposed exile to avoid jail on a corruption conviction. Public opinion swung behind Abhisit, a 45-year-old, British-born, Oxford-educated economist who came to power in December as Thailand's third prime minister in four months with support from the royalist, military and business elite.

Fast-forward to August. Abhisit has yet to win over the majority rural poor, Thaksin's red-shirted political base who fume at being cut out of the democratic process, overlooked in Thailand's economic boom and marginalised by the Bangkok elite.

"Thaksin remains very popular. He is effectively chipping away at Abhisit's coalition rather successfully," said Stephen Vickers, Hong Kong-based chief executive officer of FTI International Risk Ltd, which advises investors in Thailand.

"The trouble for Abhisit is that he has not done any damage or significant damage to Thaksin's support level. And I think occasionally we're seeing some examples of panic -- not too much -- but some elements of panic in the government," he added.

Illustrating his point, the government invoked a seldom-used Internal Security Act on Tuesday to clear the way for Abhisit and the military to move quickly, without declaring a state of emergency, if Sunday's crowd becomes unruly.

Government security agencies are urging Abhsit to deploy 5,500 soldiers on Sunday and ban protesters from gathering in front of his office, as the red-shirt leaders had planned.

Political analysts say the government may fear a reprise of a three-week blockade of the premier's office in April that sparked Thailand's worst street violence in 17 years, forcing Abhisit to call a state of emergency and stoking concerns over the stability of Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy.

'RATTLING THE ADMINISTRATION'
...Thaksin's supporters have said they have no intention of violence and plan to end their protest peacefully at midnight. It would be the fifth big show of support for Thaksin since April. Abhisit has said he fears troublemakers will incite violence.....

Part of the problem, he added, is that Abhisit has pursued with little success Thaksin-style policies, such as cheap health care and development funds for rural villages, as part of stimulus measures during the worst recession in 11 years. But while these gave Thaksin election victories, they've done little to help Abhisit. In opinion polls by Assumption University, Abhisit was rated a less competent economic leader than Thaksin. A July poll showed Thaksin marginally more popular.....

NO SIGN OF PULLING BACK
But despite Thaksin's stubborn popularity, it is unclear what he hopes to achieve from his self-imposed exile, mainly in Dubai. He has sought a royal pardon from 81-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej in a bid to return a free man. Legal experts expect that to fail.

He shows no sign of pulling back from his challenge to Abhisit and his allies, the urban elite centred in Bangkok who wear the king's traditional colour of yellow at protests.

Some analysts say he hopes to return to recover $2 billion from his days as a telecommunications tycoon that was frozen by the government after the 2006 coup.

Others say he is trying to stop Abhisit from consolidating power, hoping to raise enough pressure to force a snap election that could take place next year -- a scenario in which Thaksin's popularity could help the Puea Thai party he backs win the most votes, if not an outright majority.

Abhisit, who leads the Democrat Party, rules a shaky coalition cobbled together in December by senior military leaders, bringing in some of Thaksin's old allies.

"I don't know whether he really does want to come back to power. People just assume that," said Chris Baker, author of several books on Thaksin. "I think he's more interested in the money than the power."

Thaksin's red-shirted supporters seek compromise, he added. "It's a simple compromise -- a return to the electoral process."

The toll on the economy, meanwhile, is growing. Business leaders say the street protests following an airport takeover in November undermined the confidence of their clients. Economists say the political uncertainty damages tourism and will limit how fast Thailand's $260 billion economy rebounds from recession.....

<quote>
BANGKOK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - "Red shirt" supporters of ousted Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra have postponed Sunday's planned rally outside the office of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva because of a tight security law passed this week.

The United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) said it would hold the rally on Sept. 5, four days after the new law expires, instead.

The law passed on Tuesday allows the military to act fast if protests turn violent, without declaring a state of emergency. At least 5,000 troops were on standby ahead of the rally.....

The prospect of more demonstrations will add to fears of an escalation in Thailand's four-year political crisis, and may dent the confidence of investors and tourists, hampering Abhisit's efforts to revive the economy....

Abhisit told reporters the security law would remain effective until Tuesday, and the government would discuss what to do with it at a cabinet meeting the same day.....

The UDD's three-week occupation of the seat of government in April led to Thailand's worst street violence in 17 years, forcing Abhisit to call a state of emergency, triggering concern about the stability of Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy.....

Analysts say Thaksin is seeking to discredit Abhisit and his squabbling coalition to force new elections, which the pro-Thaksin Puea Thai party is widely expected to win, albeit without an outright majority....

<quote>
4 Sept [NYTimes] PAKA LUE SONG, Thailand -.... Paka Lue Song, only a 15-minute drive from the provincial capital, Pattani, is a starting point for Thailands influx of troops into the countrys troubled southern provinces, where ethnic Malay Muslims are battling for autonomy from Thailands Buddhist majority.

The number of people in security forces, including the army, the police and militias, in the region has doubled over the past two years to about 60,000, said Srisompob Jitpiromsri, a leading expert on the insurgency and the associate dean at Prince of Songkla University in Pattani.

The huge increase in security forces initially helped reduce the violence as well as the death toll, which fell by 40 percent last year. But the number of killings has risen in recent months. More than 330 people have been killed so far this year, compared with 285 in the same period last year. Among the dead are civilians  including many Malays  soldiers and insurgents.

There have been so many killings in the three southern provinces  about 3,500 since 2004  that the government began distributing a glossy brochure last year guiding victims families through the process of applying for government compensation.

Although the insurgency has been active for decades in the south, the current phase is considered particularly dangerous because the militants appear to have more of an Islamist agenda and because apparently sectarian attacks have strained the mutual tolerance between Buddhists and Muslims. It also comes at a time of deep political turmoil and social unease in Thailand that has hobbled several governments in the last three years and last year drove away many of the tourists who help sustain the countrys economy.

The surge in troops is palpable across the three southern provinces, only a few hours drive from Thailands main tourist beaches. There is now the equivalent of one soldier or police officer for every seven households. Soldiers in Humvees patrol the main roads, and police and military checkpoints screen motorists every few miles.

The insurgency has been distinct from other rebel movements in the region because the perpetrators remain shadowy, ill-defined groups that do not claim responsibility for the violence. Experts say they believe that the aims of the groups, among them the Pattani Islamic Mujahedeen Movement and the National Revolution Front-Coordinate, are to drive Buddhists from the area, discredit the government and put into place strict Islamic laws.

Although they say they believe that some financing for the groups comes from abroad, several counterterrorism experts in Thailand and elsewhere discount significant connections with other militant movements, like Al Qaeda and the Indonesian group Jemaah Islamiyah. The movement here, they say, appears to involve a localized struggle over territory and control overlaid with historical resentment over the domination of the Thai state.

Malay Muslims make up about 80 percent of the 1.7 million people living in Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala Provinces.....

This is two weeks before a major protest by supporters of oustered premier Thaksin. It is a wrong time to put the national police chief under pressure leading to his resignation.

<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jcMrjaC23z5Ob2fD2n9xUMlmbrzg">Tension as under-fire Thai police chief quits</a>

<quote>
6 hrs ago [AFP] BANGKOK  Thailand's national police chief resigned on Wednesday, days after an anti-graft body held him responsible for deadly clashes between anti-government protesters and police last year.

General Patcharawat Wongsuwan handed in his resignation to Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva just hours after the premier shifted him to a desk job, following months of trying to remove the senior policeman.

But his resignation is likely to create tensions between the police force and the government less than two weeks before a major protest by supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

The National Anti-Corruption Commission ruled on Monday that Patcharawat violated criminal law during a crackdown on anti-Thaksin "Yellow Shirt" demonstrators who surrounded parliament in October 2008......

Abhisit has already tried to remove Patacharawat several times and has been at odds with his allies in the ruling coalition over the appointment of a new chief to replace him.

He has accused Patcharawat, the younger brother of defence minister Prawit Wongsuwan, of obstructing an investigation into the attempted assassination of the leader of the "Yellow Shirt" movement in April.....

The government is now likely to have fears about the commitment of the security forces to tackling protests by pro-Thaksin "Red Shirts" set for September 19, the third anniversary of the military coup that ousted Thaksin.

Thaksin himself is a former policeman.....

Today, Sept 19, is the 3rd anniversary of a military coup, and is day the red-shirt protesters are gathering.

Antigovernment activists plan to defy a tough security law to rally Saturday on the third anniversary of a military coup.

19 Sept [CSMonitor] Bangkok, Thailand - Antigovernment protesters are gathering Saturday in Bangkok to mark the third anniversary of a military coup against former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. At least 30,000 are likely to attend the rally, defying the use of a tough internal security law that allows troops to make arrests.

The protesters will wear red shirts and voice support for Mr. Thaksin, who is living in exile. In April, armed troops put down violent protests in Bangkok by the red shirts after they had disrupted a regional summit. Some of the leaders of the movement face criminal charges.

Last year saw rival yellow-shirted protesters occupy government buildings and two airports. That group has since formed a political party and is loosely aligned with Prime Minister Abhisit Vejajjiva, who took office last December after the courts dissolved a pro-Thaksin administration.

Since the coup, Thailand has been held hostage by its fractious politics, to the alarm of the US, a longtime ally. Its Army is also battling a growing Muslim-led insurgency in its southernmost provinces.

What do the protesters want and how much support do they have?
They have called for Mr. Abhisit to dissolve parliament and hold elections. More broadly, the leaders say they are fighting for social justice and accuse powerful elites in Bangkok of undermining democracy.

The red-shirt movement isn't well organized and relies heavily on Thaksin's popularity to galvanize supporters. But it has tapped into the anger among rural and working-class voters over the coup and subsequent events. A recent petition for a royal pardon for Thaksin got 3.5 million signatures.

Analysts say pro-Thaksin lawmakers would probably win if elections were held today. At the last elections in December 2007, the now-defunct People's Power Party won 233 out of 480 seats in parliament.

The reds lost credibility, though, when the April protests descended into chaos. Some liberals are turned off by Thaksin, a billionaire businessman who won landslide election victories in 2001 and 2005. Last year he was convicted of abusing power, and his two terms were shadowed by human-rights abuses.

After nearly four years of upheaval, Thais are disenchanted by politics in general: only 31 percent think the country is moving in the right direction, according to a survey by the Asia Foundation.

Who was behind last year's protests? Could they start again?
The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) wears royalist yellow and was formed in 2006, when Thaksin was in power. Its leaders include a media tycoon, a former mayor, and a trade unionist. Its followers are mostly conservatives who fear losing privileges under strong elected governments.

Last year, the PAD held nonstop protests for several months. It draws support from the upper and middle classes in Bangkok and southern Thailand (though not the insurgency zone), as well as from individuals in the palace, military, and civil service. While largely peaceful, it had armed security guards.

The protests peaked with the weeklong seizure of Bangkok's two airports. After the courts dissolved the government, the PAD told its supporters to go home. It later registered its own New Politics party.

In April, PAD leader Sondhi Limthongkul survived an assassination attempt that he blamed on rogue Army officers. No arrests have been made.

The PAD has organized its own, smaller protest Saturday  hundreds of miles from Bangkok on the disputed Thai-Cambodia border. The PAD accuses Cambodia of usurping Thai territory around a temple, an issue it also used last year to stir up nationalist sentiments against the pro-Thaksin government.

How strong is the current prime minister?
A UK-educated economist, Abhisit has support from influential business groups that have applauded his government's ability to ramp up spending in a weak economy. After facing down the protests in April with minimal bloodshed, Abhisit got a boost in the polls.

But his six-party coalition is beset by infighting and minor scandals. In recent weeks, he has struggled to assert his authority over the selection of a new police chief, exposing his weak hand. Analysts say Abhisit needs a proper electoral mandate to shore up his political capital.

An election is risky, though, as long as pro-Thaksin parties hold sway over the populous north and northeast. Minor coalition parties also want to stay in power long enough to benefit from stimulus spending that can be diverted into campaign funds.....

Where do the military and the monarchy stand?
The military supports Abhisit. But its loyalty can't be counted on. There are also splits within the military over how to deal with Thaksin, whom they deposed in 2006 on the grounds of corruption, abuse of power, and offenses to the monarchy.

The military remains the power behind the government. Last year, it defied an elected government by refusing to disperse the PAD protests at the airports. Military chiefs called publicly for the prime minister to resign.

Analysts say civilian rule has been severely weakened by the coup and subsequent events. The officer corps still believes that it knows best when it comes to running Thailand, says Chris Baker, a historian in Bangkok.....

The crown remains the linchpin of Thai politics. The frailty of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-serving monarch, has intensified the struggle for power, as his designated successor, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, lacks his stature and experience.

Some red shirts are dismissive of the monarchy and its meddling in politics, though strict defamation laws prevent public debate. Senior royals were believed to have backed the PAD.

How is this affecting the economy and tourism?
The economy is shrinking but is expected to show a recovery by year-end, in line with other export-led Asian economies. The official estimate is a contraction of between 2.5 and 3.5 percent.

Government spending is fueling the recovery, but private investment remains weak. However, Thailand's banks and large companies remain solvent as their balance sheets are relatively conservative.

Tourism has taken a severe hit from the global slowdown, H1N1 flu, and fears over security for travelers, particularly in Bangkok. Many luxury hotels in the capital are running at below 50 percent occupancy. Overall visitor numbers dropped by around 20 percent in the first six months of the year.

Last year tourism was worth around $17 billion, or 6 percent of GDP. It also employs millions of people, many in small businesses that are the lifeblood of the Thai economy.

The pro-Thaksin red-shirt protest had been announced beforehand. But why is there another protest, by the PAD yellow-shirts on the same day?

And as the latter are not really against the current government, why are they protesting on the same day when the PM is away at the UN assembly like 3 years ago when the then PM Thaksin went on the same UN trip ?

To stir up another military coup?

<quote>
20 Sept THAILAND - The country was hit by two mass protests yesterday when about 20,000 anti-government red shirts held a rally in Bangkok and thousands of the rival yellow shirts marched towards a disputed border area near Si Sa Ket.

The Bangkok protest was generally peaceful although it was disrupted by a heavy downpour.

However, the march by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) to a cliff next to the disputed area near the Preah Vihear temple led to a clash between the yellow shirts and local villagers, who said they feared the protest would further sour ties with Cambodia.

The red shirts gathered at the Royal Plaza to mark the third anniversary of the military coup that ousted the government of Thaksin Shinawatra, who is now a fugitive overseas.....

The unstable political division in Thailand is still not well resolved. But a number of high level political summit are being held in Thailand as it is the current chair of the Association ASEAN. The next one is the summit of ASEAN plus 6 later in October.

<quote>
9 Oct [AsiaOne] BANGKOK - Thailand announced plans Friday to mobilise a 18,000-strong security force at a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders this month to prevent anti-government protests.

The summit of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and six dialogue partners - China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand - takes place in the coastal resort of Hua Hin on October 23-25.

Supporters of ousted Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra, known as the "Red Shirts", stormed the last summit in the beach town of Pattaya in April, forcing some regional leaders to flee the venue in helicopters.
The meeting had been postponed from December and moved out of its original location in Bangkok after rival demonstrators from the anti-Thaksin "Yellow Shirt" movement blockaded the capital's airports.

Intent on preventing a repeat of the embarrassing chaos, Thailand - which remains deeply politically divided - is invoking heavy security measures at the upcoming summit, including a harsh internal security law.....

While the Red Shirts have not yet indicated whether they will target the summit, it is considered unlikely as Hua Hin is the site of one of the main palaces of Thailand's widely revered king.

But Panitan said they had received intelligence reports that some other groups, such as environmental activists, could be planning rallies during the meeting.....

March 11 (Bloomberg) -- Thai anti-government protesters plan to march on major roads in Bangkok tomorrow, risking a confrontation with security forces charged with preventing them from paralyzing traffic.

Members of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship intends to march on main traffic arteries, said Weng Tojirakarn, a protest leader. The group plans to gather at five locations in Bangkok at noon tomorrow and assemble 1 million people to pressure Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to call an election.

Violent protests that began with plans similar to tomorrows have depressed stocks and hurt consumer confidence since the military ousted fugitive ex-leader Thaksin Shinawatra In 2006. His supporters say appointed judges, soldiers and bureaucrats have undermined the wishes of voters.....

The foolishness of that decision in 2006 becomes clearer by the day. The King is old and ill, there is no guarantee that his successor will enjoy the same respect &amp; the country is probably more deeply divided that at any time since the early 70s. For all his flaws (and they were legion) Thaksin led a movement with that genuinely represents a large &amp; generally overlooked segment of Thai society. if they decide that there is no hope at the ballot box then the drips of blood so far will become a flowing stream.

As a Thai freind of mine (and no fan of Thaksin) commented in 2006 "they (the generals) just set the country back 20 years". I hope it is only as bad as that.

I was in Bangkok during 2009 April when the ASEAN leaders had to be airlifted out of the summit venue when it was stormed by the Red Shirt protesters.

The divisions in the nation run deep. Even members of the same family, husband and wife, father and son stand on opposing sides. I love the Thai people and the country. The longer this political deadlock goes the harder it becomes for Thailand to solve its problems; and problems, there are many:

1. The king is old and feeble. His successor, the crown prince, is deeply unpopular.
2. Thaksin, although had lot of support from the rural areas, was was no saint himself and was involved in many shady business dealings.
3. The yellow shirt coup was orchestrated by the privileged ruling elite backed by the military who felt threated by Thaksin's growing popularity and populist programs. The Thai people claim that Abhisit Vejjajiva (the current Thai prime-minister) is just a puppet and the real powers lie behind the scene.
4. Then there is the grim (and ignored) specter of religious insurgency in South Thailand's Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani provinces.

The best thing for Thailand right now would probably be elections, free and fair. IMV Thaksin seems to be the lesser among all the evils...

-Shinawatra family flees Thailand before rally

-Puea Thai MP Chalerm leaves for Singapore,
will return 'once tensions eased'...

-Thaksin urges supporters to join protest
"for the future of our children"

RSS news feed articles:

Arrow <a href="http://www.bahtsold.com/news?id=2452">Thailand Classified Ads | BahtSOLD.com | Major Puea Thai figures flee Thailand</a>

Of mice and men...

Predictable headlines, meanwhile, where are Mr Thaksin's 'children' while he is imploring others to bring THEIR families to protest 'for OUR children' at the same time?

Unfortunately (predictably) concern for the 'potential' for violence at the red rally this weekend has been greatly increased with these anticipated developments.

Similar to last year's red-riots at Songkran, the Thaksin family are again jetted away to safety and first class comfort. All the while Mr Thaksin is (again) urging his poor (and poorly misguided) followers to bring THEIR families to protest...

Meanwhile, Chief of Mr Thaksin's Puea Thai MP's (the right honourable Mr Chalerm) has also left (for Singapore) stating he will return 'once tensions are eased'... Such brave leadership displayed from a man who reportedly desires to be Mr Thaksin's latest proxy replacement Prime Minister...

One wonders if proud and fearless father/mentor Chalerm has also taken care of his own 'kids' once again? A bit more background from this TIME article:

Arrow <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,185060,00.html">The Untouchables - TIME</a>

(resulting in a new 'happy toilet' re-birth for the Chalerm boys, as most witnesses suffered from 'sudden memory-loss syndrome'...)

Double standards? Elites? Hypocrisy?

These are some of the orchestrated rallying cries from the red 'handlers' as the lower ranks receive marching orders from a rich-elite-criminal-hypocrite (and consummate coward).

One would dearly like to see the poor in Thailand get a REAL self-sustaining leg up (for once and for all). No more cycles of cynically piling on debt, then forgiving debt (for votes), all designed to keep poor villagers indebted to Mr Thaksin but never truly getting ahead (of course). Conveniently providing the perfect set-up for a self-serving megalomaniac autocrat. Nor does one wish to see the same poor 'used' to sacrifice their blood (or others) on the streets, ultimately to allow one man a chance to regain power and riches (while the masses stay 'conveniently' trapped to be re-used for the same purpose)

Elections or Red-Herring?

As stated before, the red-rally cry to call elections appears a complete red-herring (and the red leaders know it). Of course, they don't bother to explain to the red masses Mr Thaksin's Puea Thai Party could only win a MINORITY govt (again) and without a sizable coalition partner this time, they would be OUT in the first majority house vote.

Thus, this is *NOT* about elections (nor democracy) and the man who controls the strings and purse-strings knows he must overthrow the govt using any and ALL 'other' means. This is the ONLY way he can reverse convictions, reverse fortunes, exact revenge and MOST importantly create a chance to double-up depleted accounts...

Potential for violence

One can now say with certainty there will be some violent incidents starting this weekend, most likely on Sunday evening and into Monday.

There are indications attempts to block strategic intersections in and around Bangkok may take place earlier than Sunday. However, it's unlikely this tactic may work until the reds can amass more 'boots on the ground' by Sunday. If they attempt this strategy prematurely with limited numbers, look for citizens trying to make their way through Bangkok to react 'strongly'.

Hot spots to avoid

Expats and tourists will NOT be 'targeted' (of course) but especially from this Sunday it's best to stay off main Bangkok streets and avoid downtown shopping centres. This is NOT to say shopping centres will be targeted either, rather it's just common sense to ensure one isn't accidentally caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Expats and Tourists in Bangkok

If you're an Expat living in Bangkok, perhaps best to stay home this Sunday and keep a safe eye on events. If you're a tourist already in Bangkok and booked into a hotel, best stay in the hotel on Sunday and do likewise.

Arriving Sunday?

If you're flying in on Sunday, best to check the latest news developments and if there are any signs of violence, avoid travelling into the city.

Taxis may also be scarce (70% of drivers are said to be attending the rally) and some main roads/intersections will likely be blocked by security or reds (or both in some cases). There are hotels near the airport and bus/van service to Pattaya and points east if needing an alternative.

Will the airport be over-run by reds? Not likely, but possibly only in a last-ditch attempt scenario (ie; if all else fails) but one expects this contingency will be prepared for this time around (thankfully).

Truth has no colour

Speaking of airport closures, some readers may take umbrage and wish to believe this is being written by a 'yellow' shirt. However, long-time readers will know this writer has also taken the 'yellows' to task over their past actions. This writer is simply part of the 'white-shirt' majority who are completely fed up with 'colourful' protests by all hues (and coups as well).

Last 'hurrah'?

With the economy showing signs of improvement in several sectors along with consistent gains in GDP and jobs, Mr Thaksin may not have many more opportunities to amass (or instigate some might say) such an 'uprising'. But as long as Mr Thaksin has funds, he will likely never cease his attempts to 're-coup' losses and gain a chance to double-up.

It's sadly ironic, the man who wishes to 'return to help Thailand' seems bent on first pitting citizen against citizen and possibly destroying the country, to reach his true goals...

If even one man, woman, or heaven forbid child is hurt (or worse) in one man's never-ending megalomaniac lust for greed and power, Mr Thaksin will have blood on his hands (yet again).

Win or lose, sleep well

Mai pen rai, 'win or lose' and regardless of loss of life or limb of his supporters and innocents on the streets of Thailand, Mr Thaksin and his family will be secure, sleeping in first class comfort and safety, far, far away.

This tells everything one needs to know about the character of a man who also has the gall to liken his struggle to Nelson Mandela...

What to expect this weekend?

First, a fresh quote from Puea Thai MP and red co-leader Natthawut:

"Changing Thailand means changing the regime of government. The government must be made to face the fact that it cannot maintain law and order and thus will have to dissolve the House"

According to every poll, we already know Puea Thai could only form a minority govt (again). But this time without a main coalition partner they wouldn't survive a house vote. Thus, elections cannot be the 'real' aim here (which Mr Thaksin and the Puea Thai/Red Leaders must be FULLY aware of).

Therefore, in order to be 'successful' in 'changing the regime of government', chaos would have to be created. As red co-leader Natthawut states the 'government must be made to face the fact that it cannot maintain law and order'.

To this end, apart from a main unpredictable rally, several pockets of street riots would have to occur simultaneously in Bangkok (and in towns up-country) along with small explosions, fires, traffic blockades etc in strategic locations, giving the apparent desired Red/Thaksin impression that the govt 'cannot maintain law and order'.

How big will the 'rally' be?

The size of the rally 'could' possibly near 100,000 this time, due to the seeming 'do or die' timing of events (but the promised 1,000,000 is not remotely possible).

Judging from last April's red-riots, the majority non-core rally goers would likely melt away (punch the time-clock) again overnight Sunday, leaving a core group of somewhere between 10-30,000 this time around. The core group will have to be corralled and this may take a bit longer than last time. They could be more spread around the city and in greater #s than last time out.

Who's on-side?

Besides containing any unrest in Bangkok, there will likely be several up-country hot-spots to deal with and many local Thaksin-loyal authorities may not be very obliging (or worse), acerbating the situation.

Also, the majority of police are reportedly Thaksin supporters (afterall, who better to 'serve and protect' their mutual ways...) Plus, with PM Abhisit essentially sacking some top-cops over alleged bribes for promotions, they too may not be very helpful (again).

The armed forces themselves are split as well, with several influential retired Generals signing on to Mr Thaksin's Puea Thai Party in recent months. This and other influential loyalty factors could become a key element of how events evolve. This is a wee bit worrying, however, like last Songkhran, one suspects they won't have the numbers for what would be a messy re-coup (or worse, potentially with split security factions facing off).

How long will the 'rally' last?

Despite the potential to create unrest on many fronts, one has faith the govt is prepared to handle the situation under very difficult circumstances and will ultimately prevail. All should hopefully be wrapped up (or at the least contained) by mid to late next week and one sincerely hopes for a minimum of injuries or worse (some causalities may be more Red leaders and Puea Thai MP's becoming 'honourary' citizens of Cambodia...)

Last word on developments to this minute is from a following Thai press commentary:

"Although Thaksin is the one crying out to be "saved", it's his country that needs all the help it can get"... Exclamation

Hear, hear.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS:

All latest developments will be monitored closely this weekend and will be updated below on THIS thread.

Those who followed the updates here from last Songkran will know all news sources will be monitored and all updates will be quickly posted in a calm, rational and hopefully objective manner.

As one who loves Thailand and despite the increasingly worrying signs, here's hoping the coming rallies may yet go off peacefully. Idea

Edit to add: This site does not seek to cynically make revenue by stirring up or 'creating' sensationalised headlines (like another Thailand site). Also, this site does not seek to gain revenue based on useless 'page views' of sponsors banners like the other site. Why anyone would sponsor a site which seems to exist primarily to bash Thailand (for profit) remains a mystery, albeit apparently a profitable one (at least for that site, and one assumes their sponsor advertisers don't mind getting regularly ridiculed and bashed from its members, along with receiving little returns <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>

To 'sum-up', THIS site will send as FEW breaking news updates as possible and only to assist viewers who have an interest in Thailand, or have loved ones here, or business, or those who just have a love of Thailand and will be rightfully concerned.

If you're seeking information as events unfold, all updates will be posted here. However, if one is seeking multiple pages of almost pure vitriol, perhaps sign up for that site which is desperately seeking subscriptions for its 49 baht per month 'GOOD News for Expats' plan... Embarassed

Meanwhile, this site remains free and completely focused on providing accurate information from multiple sources for concerned viewers as key events unfold.

Well, so far so good. If the detractors would take the time to do so, please point out the exact references you disagree with, this would be appreciated.

Again, not a 'yellow', not a 'red', not for airport closures or coups as is well documented. And after years of instigated unrest, very tired of protests by any and all sides.

Might add, good to see no viewers are at all concerned at the potential for unrest or worse this weekend and apparently believe all will be 100% peaceful... sincerely hope you are right Exclamation

I'm no Taksin supporter, yes he did more for the poor than any of the rich, elite of this country ever will, remember Taksin is rich but he "ain't one of them" and so he wasn't allowed to be corrupt and line his pockets, but all politicians, top ranking Police and military are all at it. So what was the difference, that's right "he wasn't one of them"!

So yes the red shirts are mad to do his dirty work, yes his motives are pure greed, yes this article is written by a yellow shit supporter, but this government is a farce, they got there by 1st using the military back door to over-run the Taksin government, when they lost the vote they kept sacking parties and members through kangaroo courts until they had the majority vote in the house. The obvious thing to do would be to call a general election, that's what any normal government/country would do, so they are obviously still afraid they may lose the vote/power.

This country will never change it is full of power crazy corrupt officials in every aspect of life here, from the top down, and they only have one general goal - keep the poor poor, "cos I just love it when I click my fingers and all the traffic stops and how everyone bows and whays me as I go by". I feel sorry for these inocent, poor, uneducated people they have no chance to move up in life as long as there is greed and power running the country

My apology for my inexperience in forum speak and errors in previous submissions !

As I attempted to relate....... I live in the northeast amongst rice farmers. That same population is the theoretical support for dear Mr Thaksin. The help referred to that he gave was not given at all in real terms. For every baht offered another went in the back pocket! And those cheap loans? Never expected to be paid back.... just a perpetual grasp on voters ! The Health Care? That was nation wide was it not? And originally called the 35 Bht program? Now is free ! Supported still because it is a good thing, not neccesarily to retain "populist" appeal!

Government guaranteed minimum prices for product is exploitation?

The new regime has not trumpeted a renewed loan scheme....it has actively sought to offer cheap loans on prudent terms. To promote proper continuous local development and to help ease previous lenders out of loan deals from loan sharks. Which is more than the previous efforts which only succeeded in increasing Thai whisky sales because the amounts were not useful enough for more!

The perception that a majority of Issan support the previous regime is only due to the squeaky wheel syndrome suffered by a desperate few! Why do the majority not get heard? Because they are busy with the harsher reality of life.And because they would prefer to avoid the aggressive attention of scarlet henchmen! Yes, they do fear! Night violence does occur! Is that a good move by would be Fascists??

Debate and comment occur daily about Mr Thaksin &amp; Co. But positive opinion about same is rare to hear! Apathy is the enemy but no one person can alter that in any hurry! Crying or Very sad But sadly is possible that reaction against the rainbow effect will be with justifiable wrath!

Personally I find it impossible to find any sympathy for people who would encourage violent puplic terrorisation and hide when it starts! And whatever colour the shirt those sort wear I can only see as dirty! Mad

Ed update:
March 12, 2010 (2:15 pm)

The latest reports have it that the protesters are few in number (as expected for Friday) and will cease activities at 5 pm today and then 're-group' on Sunday.

Meanwhile, pockets of red-shirts may be seen 'canvassing' for supporters in the Sukhumvit area and others this afternoon.

The bulk of the protesters from the North and NE are reportedly setting off today and will join up with the rally on Sunday.

Thus, as indicated earlier, Sunday will be the 'official' start.

The UN has announced it is closing its offices in Bangkok this Monday. Expect more to follow suit. Thai Airways will close its Silom offices and requests passengers arrive 3 hours in advance for Suvarnabhumi Airport check-ins.

There were a series of small explosions reported in Surat Thani earlier today. Thankfully no injuries and only minor damage was reported. It is useless to speculate on responsibility as the details are vague.
--------

*Only 'main' updates/developments will be posted here (for now). Also, only in the event a situation evolves which may directly affect public safety would an alert be sent.

One wishes both protesters and security forces a peaceful rally with no provocation or harm.

Update:
Friday March 12, 4:30 pm

INN reports the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is stating Mr Thaksin may have left Dubai and they are checking rumors that he is on his way to Cambodia's Siem Reap province.

Before jumping to conclusions, it's worth noting both sides are engaged in PR spin and this is only a 'rumour' (originating from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs apparently).

Meanwhile, The Nation is reporting a 'source' as stating Mr Thaksin has actually been in Cambodia for a few days.

Undoubtedly Cambodia's Hun Sen and Mr Thaksin are 'reciprocal' allies but these 'reports' may or may not hold weight. More on this if, or as it comes available.

8 Apr Assoc Press Unrest in Thailand and controversy over Myanmar's elections are likely to overshadow a summit of 10 Southeast Asian leaders who had intended to focus on economic matters.

The summit was set to open in Hanoi on Thursday, one day after Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared a state of emergency in the face of escalating anti-government protests. At the last minute, he canceled his participation in the 16th annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

"The situation in Bangkok is worrying, and it's a somber backdrop to our discussions," Singaporean Foreign Minister George Yeo said. "I really hope that the situation there will not lead to violence."

Quick update. The government closed an opposition aligned tv station, and in retaliation the protesters stormed a tv station used by the government. The government backed down and allowed the TV station they had closed earlier to start operating again.

Thousands flee Bangkok
BEN DOHERTY, BANGKOK

April 11, 2010 - 10:51AM

Up to 15 people have been killed and thousands of tourists forced to flee, after Thai soldiers opened fire on red-shirt protesters in Bangkok in pitched battles all over the city.

After a month-long standoff between the anti-government red-shirts and Thai security forces, troops yesterday moved in to remove the red-shirts from the key intersections theyd occupied in the Thai capital.

But, meeting a resolute red-shirt army, the previously good-natured demonstrations suddenly turned violent.

Reports say up to 15 people were killed - a hospital spokesman last night confirmed 10 deaths - and more than 600 injured, after soldiers, who initially fired rubber bullets at protesters, began firing live rounds.

Four soldiers are believed to have been killed in the rioting and violence which followed. No Australians are among the dead or injured.

Some of the fiercest fighting occurred at the eastern end of famed tourist strip, Khao San Road, when riot police, backed by soldiers, attempted to push back red-shirt protesters from their base.

Nicholas Gilmore, 26, from Perth, said the red-shirt protesters refused and then, faced with advancing lines of police and soldiers, began throwing rocks and pieces of brick.

I was just standing there, taking pictures, then the guy near me threw something at the troops... I think it was a bamboo stick... and they just started shooting at him.

The first bullet just missed me, it was so loud, I could feel it come right past me, it must have missed me by a foot.

Mr Gilmore told The Age that the troops fired rubber bullets initially.

But then, as I was standing round the corner, someone said they were firing live rounds, so I wasnt too keen to come around again. They were just firing and firing, indiscriminately.

There were explosions going off too, I dont know what they were, but they were incredibly loud.

Peter Foster, 23, and Ryan Bekavak, 25, from Brisbane were caught on the rooftop of the hotel for more than three hours as the gun battle raged below them.

Helicopters which had been circling overhead all afternoon dropped teargas to try to disperse the protesters.

But then the gunshots started, and it was just continuous,they just kept firing. We couldnt move from where we were in the hotel, but we could just kept hearing more and more shots fired, Mr Foster said.

Late last night, the red-shirts were in control of much of Bangkok. While cordons of troops were still on the streets, most of the key intersections in the capital were controlled by red-shirts.

The protesters set up makeshift barriers using logs, metal barricades and barbed wire to stop police and army vehicles moving through.

Through the middle of the night, thousands of red-shirts remained on the streets, promising their protest would continue throughout Songkran, the Thai New Year celebrations this week

Are other states involved beyond the standard "we pray for peace?" or is it purely domestic?

I don't know enough about who is right and who is wrong (most likely both) in this conflict but this Thaksin guy takes the cake. Guy gets deposed in a coup and then goes off to England to buy Manchester City, a Premiership soccer team. Accusations come from the Thai government he stole money from the country to finance it (which regardless of how he got the money, it reflects very badly on the Premiership to accept him in as an owner if there was any shadiness involved with a sovereign government). And as the article says above, him and his family are out of the country telling people to fight for him. Dear God, have the balls to at least be in the country if you're calling for civil war. It's such a p*ssy coward manuever and it reflects badly on his supporters that they don't realize this. These people depose the current government in a coup, and Thaksin is going to fly in and take command as the people that fought on the ground give up control voluntarily? Doesn't strike me as likely.

I don't have time for a detailed reply.

First, mainly domestic.

Second, the vast bulk of the wrong here is not with Thaksin. He made his money before he went into politics, though he was not clean while in power (par for the course in Thailand &amp; no worse than Berlusconi). He did try to monkey with the system (see berluscoini again), but his party has twice been removed from power after clearly winning elections. The reason he isn't in the country is that he has no faith in the government giving him a fair trial - with good reason. The real nastiness here is the people who think that elections don't matter &amp; that real power comes from the barrel of a gun. They are the ones you should be focussing on, they have done their nation immeasurable harm. Nothing Thaksin has ever tried to do comes close.

Good point Xinhui. This has gone way past Thaksin, which is why it has become so dangerous. It looks like there may be moves toward a new election, but unless the 'royalist' side lets the result reflect the vote &amp; accepts if it loses then that will probably make things worse. Their response to the last 2 elections does not breed confidence.

Reuters

Thailand's tense political standoff was nearing a climax Thursday with anti-government protesters preparing for imminent battle in central Bangkok against tens of thousands of armed troops.

The "red shirt" uprising showed the first signs of spreading beyond Bangkok to the protesters' stronghold in the northeast after they blocked a train carrying troops.

The red shirts mistakenly thought the train was on its way to Bangkok, but it was taking troops and military vehicles to the south to help contain a Muslim insurgency, a railway police officer told Reuters by telephone from Khon Kaen.

Some 40,000 red-shirted supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra have fortified their redoubt in a Bangkok commercial district with home-made barricades, expecting the army to evict them any time.

"We've heard from insiders in the government that April 26 is their deadline," Kwanchai Sarakam, 57, a red shirt leader from the northeast told Reuters.

Neither side shows any sign of wanting to back down following the army's chaotic attempt to evict protesters from another site on April 10 that led to the deaths of 25 people and wounded more than 800.

Red shirt leaders say another such attempt would be futile. They say they will only leave Bangkok when the prime minister announces a dissolution of parliament and early elections.

"I'm sending a signal (by remaining at the site and fortifying it) that I want to see their cards," Nattawut Saikuar, one of the three top red shirt leaders, told Reuters Wednesday. "You cannot issue an order because the soldiers won't listen," he added, citing last Friday's bungled attempt to arrest red shirt leaders as an example.

The central bank left interest rates at a record low on Wednesday, noting political risks were "affecting confidence, tourism, private consumption and investment."

FLEXIBILITY IN DEMANDS?

Some red shirt leaders suggested Wednesday they might consider a three-month timeframe for Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to dissolve parliament and call elections.

But the movement is led by a 22-member committee that often sends mixed signals on its positions. They all agree, however, a crackdown is imminent and they are preparing for battle.

Red shirt leaders said they planned to march to the U.N. regional headquarters Thursday to ask that U.N. peacekeepers be deployed to provide security.

The army spokesman said around 900 fully armed troops on motorcycles would be deployed around the red shirt rally site at the Rachaprasong intersection to keep them going elsewhere, and checkpoints have been strengthened in Bangkok to stop red shirt reinforcements from coming into the capital.

The red shirts have fortified entrances to an upmarket shopping district with barricades made of tyres, chunks of concrete and bamboo staves, forcing posh malls and some luxury hotels to close their doors.

At one end of their sprawling encampment, leading to the Silom business district, anti-government protesters atop their barricade faced off against several hundred pro-government supporters Wednesday night throwing bottles and rocks before riot police got between them.

The Bangkok Post reported this "multi-coloured" pro-government group planned a demonstration of up to 100,000 people Friday.

About 60,000 troops have been deployed in the capital and can use live ammunition if necessary for self-defence, the newspaper quoted security officials as saying.

Any attempt to disperse them risks heavy casualties and the prospect of clashes spilling into nearby high-end residential areas. It may also lead the red shirts to step up action elsewhere in the country, particularly in their strongholds in the north and northeast where there has been little unrest so far in the six-week campaign.

In the province of Khon Kaen, about 400 km from Bangkok, around 200 protesters were still blocking the military train, police said, with the deputy governor and red shirt leaders negotiating its release.

Talks between Abhisit and the protesters collapsed last month when the red shirts rejected his offer to dissolve parliament within nine months -- a year early.

Analysts say the protests are radically different from other periods of unrest in Thailand's five-year political crisis -- and arguably in modern Thai history, pushing the country close to an undeclared civil war.

The demonstrations have evolved into a dangerous standoff between the army and a rogue military faction that supports the protesters and includes retired generals allied with twice-elected and now fugitive former premier Thaksin.

Despite the turmoil, some big foreign manufacturers -- most of them with plants well away from the capital -- said they are maintaining their investment policies.

UN: "We'll be more than happy to inject ourselves in the middle of a potential civil war and override the military authority of the currently sitting central government."

Anyway, this feels appropriate:

Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble

Tankie,

They can't fcuk off to Mecca because they were born &amp; bred in Thailand. Thanks to one of those infamous little imperial deals done by the late British Empire they ended up on the wrong side of a line the weren't asked about &amp; put in country full of Thais who don't much respect them or their beliefs. They are ethnic Malays &amp; they should never have been put there in the first place. This not a new issue &amp; Mecca is only a small part of it.

The truth is that the muslim insurgency is a sideshow that no one would give a rats about if it was shan or karens or lao or Khmer doing the violence (MUCH worse has been happening for decades across the border in Laos or Burma to general disinterest). Thais are doing themselves far more damage at the moment than even the most excitible jihadi could hope to do. Muslim/Malay extremists can wreck a few provinces. The red &amp; yellow shirts can wreck the country (already have in some respects). As someone who is also very fond of Thailand (climate notwithstanding) I also weep for the future.

Point taken B/F but ya got ta understand where in coming from, if they (muslims) wants to rule in Thailand they have a bloody big gig on their hands, it aint as you know the same as the west, they (thais ) are fiercely proud and not afraid of dying for their beliefs as they believe in reincarnation, but they dont do suicide bombings in the name the muslims perceive as the way forward.I loved my time there but alas the climate did for me with my lousy health issues, but Thailand is a beautiful country, lovely people, ripped off, and sadly, happy to be so,,, until now, and i hope they get the, how can i say this, pfttt, democracy they deserve, because with the curfews in place now and British airways still charging exorbitant prices to fly there in the middle of a strike and curfew they will sadly miss the input of the farang. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/frown.gif"/>

A Thai court issued orders on Tuesday to arrest former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on terrorism charges in connection with riots over the past two months that were the worst in the country's modern history.

Armed with the arrest warrant, Thai prosecutors and the Foreign Ministry will launch a global hunt for the fugitive telecoms tycoon, a top government official said.

Thaksin was last believed to be in France for the Cannes film festival, but he keeps his location secret.

"The court said there was enough evidence to believe that Thaksin was the mastermind, having played a significant role in instructing and manipulating the incidents," Department of Special Investigations chief Tharit Pengdit told Reuters, referring to the riots.

Government officials say Thaksin funded the 10-week, anti-government protests to the tune of about $1.5 million (1.05 million pounds) a day and is believed to have organised the smuggling of arms and fighters from Cambodia.

If found guilty, he can be sentenced to death.

The red shirt protesters have demanded that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva quit and call new elections, saying they have been disenfranchised by a Bangkok elite supported by the military. They mostly support Thaksin, who was prime minister until 2006 when he was ousted in a coup.

Thaksin denied the terrorism charges on his Twitter page, <a href="http://twitter.com/thaksinlive">Thaksin Shinawatra (Thaksinlive) on Twitter</a>.

"As a prime minister who won two landslide election victories, I was ousted in a coup," Thaksin wrote in Thai. "As I was fighting peacefully for justice for the return of my robbed assets, I was slapped with terrorism charges."

At least 85 people were killed in Bangkok and more than 1,400 wounded in violence that began in April.

The violence peaked last week when almost 40 buildings were set on fire as the army dispersed thousands of anti-government protesters who had taken over the commercial heart of the city.

RHETORIC COULD INCITE TROUBLE

There have been no reports of violence in Bangkok since Thursday, when the red shirt protesters started to withdraw. But some have threatened to resume their campaign next month.

Jatuporn Prompan, a top red shirt leader who surrendered to the authorities but was freed on parliamentary immunity, said on Tuesday he did not support violence, but the current rhetoric from the government could lead to more unrest.

"A government reconciliation plan must not incite hatred, misunderstanding and finger-pointing... otherwise this volcano will erupt," Jaturon told reporters after being interviewed by investigators.

In a move to help businesses and people affected by the riots, the cabinet approved a relief plan on Tuesday, including unspecified grants and 5 billion baht ($154 million) of soft loans, Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told reporters.

Bangkok, a city of 15 million, was operating as usual on Tuesday, but the government said a night curfew would stay in force until May 29, over concerns that some remnants of the hardcore protesters could launch more attacks.

Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said the curfew, which will be in force between midnight and 4 a.m. in the capital and 23 provinces, was necessary to prevent more unrest, but would not be in place for seven days, as was announced on Monday.

"We have cut the timeframe from seven to four days because we want to limit the impact on the public," Suthep told reporters. Thaksin is no stranger to arrest warrants and court cases. He jumped bail and fled abroad in 2008 when he was facing charges of corruption and was sentenced in absentia to two years in jail.

In February, Thailand's top court seized $1.4 billion of his assets, saying it was accrued through abuse of power

Point taken B/F but ya got ta understand where in coming from, if they (muslims) wants to rule in Thailand they have a bloody big gig on their hands, it aint as you know the same as the west, they (thais ) are fiercely proud and not afraid of dying for their beliefs as they believe in reincarnation, but they dont do suicide bombings in the name the muslims perceive as the way forward

I see what you are saying Tankie. I'm pretty sure what the the muslim militants really want to rule is the 3 southern provinces they live in. They won't be allowed to &amp; nor should they. I doubt that even their Muslim compatriots want that. What I suspect they do want is a bit more autonomy &amp; the sense that they are treated as equals. What they well might get is something a LOT worse (I'm at work now, but I'll post something a bit worrying when I get home).

I loved my time there but alas the climate did for me with my lousy health issues, but Thailand is a beautiful country, lovely people, ripped off, and sadly, happy to be so,,, until now, and i hope they get the, how can i say this, pfttt, democracy they deserve, because with the curfews in place now and British airways still charging exorbitant prices to fly there in the middle of a strike and curfew they will sadly miss the input of the farang. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/frown.gif"/>

I would tell any farang to stay well away for the moment. Thailand could be on the verge of something MUCH more terrible. Each side is more entrenched than ever, the King is ill &amp; the system has broken down. There are ways out, but the charging of Thaksin with terrorism makes me fear they are not going to be taken.

I suspect that we will both be watching our TV sets in despair Tankie. Sad to see such a beautiful place in such a state. And as per usual, it will be the ordinary people who bear the brunt. They deserve better.

Another perspective on Thailand's turmoil:

Thai turmoil was no 'class war'

BERTIL LINTNER

June 7, 2010

Recent violence in Thailand was not about class at all.

We have seen the recent unrest in Thailand, with soldiers in the streets and protesters clamoring for democracy, before in South-East Asia. But was this really a clash between the "the haves" and "have-nots" as depicted by an almost unanimous chorus of foreign media?

As battles between anti-government protesters and the military killed 85 people and injured 1402, a Western academic claimed that "the farmers of Thailand have stood up". It was supposed to have been a more or less spontaneous uprising by society's poor and disadvantaged against the urban elite in Bangkok.

Superficially the scenes may have looked similar to the 1988 protests for democracy in Burma or perhaps even the 1998 uprising in Indonesia, which led to the fall of Suharto. But there are fundamental differences between those events and Thailand's "Red Shirt" protest movement  the popular name for the grouping officially known as the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD). The list of casualties speaks for itself. Of those killed, 11 were soldiers and policemen, as were 411 of the wounded. Unlike pro-democracy movements elsewhere, the UDD had its armed units and was far from the "non-violent" force it purported to be. The UDD also became infamous for its attacks on the media. Several journalists, both Thai and foreign, were threatened by UDD members and, on May 19, staff at a local television station had to flee for their lives when a mob set fire to their building, apparently "dissatisfied" with the coverage they were getting.

This should have come as no surprise: anyone who had visited Red Shirt rallies would have been struck by the language used. Although "democracy" was a catchphrase, the rest of the message was one of intolerance and even hatred of anyone who did not agree with the protesters, often peppered with obscenities. And there were always armed men around, dressed in black fatigues.

It should also not be forgotten that the movement was launched on March 12  two weeks after Thai courts had seized $1.4 billion of assets held in Thai banks of the family of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister who was ousted in 2006 and is wanted for multiple counts of corruption. But he must have had significant amounts of money saved elsewhere, because a local Red Shirt leader in Thailand's rural north-east told German press agency DPA on May 23: "Thaksin spent hundreds of millions of baht to sponsor the protest." Apart from funding from Thaksin, now in exile in Dubai, the Red Shirts are believed to have also received financial backing from other extremely wealthy families allied with him.

And although tens of thousands of people from impoverished parts of the north-east were mobilised to take part on the protests, it is significant that there is not a single representative of disadvantaged sections of society in the UDD leadership. The main leader, Jatuporn Promphan, served as secretary in the ministry of natural resources and environment in the Thaksin government and, in 2003, he and other officials ordered more than 1000 police to retake a large tract of land in the south, which had been taken over by poor farmers. They accused the government of leasing the land to big palm oil producers instead of redistributing it to the farmers. Jatuporn then defended the police action, saying the protesters were "armed" and "broke the law". During his years in power, Thaksin himself tried to stifle the media, silence critics of his regime  and launched a vicious "war on drugs", in which 2000 people were killed in extrajudicial executions.

The clash in Thailand should be described as a clash between two oligarchies. On one side, the traditional elite consisting of the old Sino-Thai plutocracy that for years have enjoyed a symbiotic and mutually beneficial relationship with the military, bureaucracy and monarchy  and the new nouveau-riche elite that began to emerge during the Vietnam War era, when the economy took off and culminated in the boom of the 1980s. Lacking the political connections of the old elite, Thaksin and his business associates built up their own power base through a string of populist policies, which won many admirers in certain parts of the country. However, the political confusion among many of the Red Shirt followers is demonstrated in a UDD Chiang Mai cafe: on the wall hang side by side portraits of Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Che Guevara  and Thaksin.

Significantly, however, the Red Shirt movement has remained a largely regional phenomenon, mainly in the northeast. UDD influence in the central plains is considerably weaker and virtually non-existent in the south. In those parts of the country  strongholds of Thaksin's sworn enemies, the Yellow Shirts  there are also many poor and disadvantaged people.

Rather than being the "class war" that the UDD likes to talk about, and the Western media seemed to believe it is, it is a conflict between old and new money, which is also pitting poor as well as rich in different parts of the country against each other. This divide is a serious problem, which any Thai government and serious political force would have to address  and not take advantage of for their own respective political agendas.

Whatever the outcome of the present crisis, the future of Thai democracy does not look good, nor does the prospect of national reconciliation. In fact, a country that only a few years ago was seen as a pillar of economic and political stability risks becoming a failed state. This frightening scenario can only be thwarted if Thailand gets solid, independent state institutions that can handle a crisis like this one  and bridge the gap between various elites as well as different parts of the country and society's rich and poor.
