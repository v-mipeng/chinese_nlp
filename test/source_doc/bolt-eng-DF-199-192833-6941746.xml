Sven Goren Eriksson's England will take on current European champions France in their opening game of the Euro 2004 Tournament in Portugal.
The rest of Group B consists of Croatia, who England defeated 3-1 a few weeks ago, and Switzerland.

And Germany vs. The Netherlands will be exciting as well - I hope.

The Full Draw

Group A: Portugal; Greece; Spain; Russia
Group B: France; England; Switzerland; Croatia
Group C: Sweden; Bulgaria; Denmark; Italy
Group D : Czech Rep; Latvia; Germany; Netherlands

germany vs latvia should be a good game too. i mean...latvia "eliminated" turkey from this last phase of the european cup (turkey was classified 3rd in the past world cup), so they must be good!

i hope portugal doesnt play sucky (as many times they do), and players like figo, rui costa, pauleta, simao, ricardo (gk), deco, be at their best.

Walter,

The UK commentators on TV and radio are naming Group D the "Group of Death" - there's always one!

Welcome, skuamb - Portugal certainly have some great players - they just need to play together!

Group A seems to be the easiest, and has already an Iberian flavor. Of course, one can always count on Spain giving a terrible game or two.
Group C is deceptive. Scandinavians are often full of surprises.
England is also often full of surprises (bitter for their fans), but it should win Group B.
Whoever goes through in Group D will either be too exhausted to do anything else or will be too strong and win the championship.

fbaezer,

I hope you're right about England winning the group. I know France did badly in the World Cup but the English still consider them to be the better side (OK, I'm an Arsenal fan - I know just how amazing Henry, Pires and Viera can be!).

i'm sure france will go to the finals. i mean... look at their team. they have such a good chemistry between all the players, and they have been playing together for a long time...

barthez, desaily, lizarazu, thuram, zidane, vieira, pires, henry, trezeguet, ETC, have been playing together since the last eurocup in 2000 if not longer.

couldn't agree more about groups A and C. You are also quite right about Group D, although it can be easily said for C as well...
However, I think your perception of Group B is completely wrong (we'll see however) - France is stronger then England from absolutely every point of view - this doesn't mean that England absolutely cannot win the group, but to put it in the position of favourite...well, I think you are very wrong - England can even have problems with Croats that usually play great on big competitions and England is still group of great, even brilliant players that does not work as team.

Hi Cristiano, welcome to A2K.

France may win.
But you don't win with names.
What ever happened of Real Madrid in 2004?
Not the Champion's League, not the Liga, not the Copa del Rey.

You both may be right. France has best players, Italy might have best TEAM. But, it's also quite important that players will once again be extremely tired. France had best players on World Cup as well and they couldn't even pass through group stage.
Okay, Euro will be more fair in that matter, because more or less all teams will be in similar position, not like in World Cup where for example asian national teams were made of players that played 40 games less during season then French players for example.
Here only Latvia will have that advantage, because other teams are either completely (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, England....) or partially (Scandinavians, Croatia, Bulgaria...) filled with "tired" players.
Russia may be potential surprise, especially if they start well. Why? Because they will be the most fresh team. They had their vacations, then pre-season, and now they played around 10 rounds of national championship - they should be in top form. And fact that they are not as good as others...well, Senegal, South Korea, USA...are not as good as France and Argentina and they were all much better placed on World Cup.

I've already made my fantasy teams.

My choices for the first games go for players from Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic, Italy, Sweden and Croatia. Too scared to put any (expensive) French, English, Dutch or German players in my teams (I think I got Davids in one of them, he was the best my spare virtual money could buy).

tip for players: as Switzerland supposed to be one of the countries with worst attack and there are 40(!) transfers allowed, someone can get the idea to use croatian goalkeeper in first round - DON'T! Our first goalie is injured and very doubtfull, and his replacement is not always in best mood

<post author="fbaezer" datetime="2004-06-11T16:29:00" id="p22">
I was tempted for a moment to include Platikosa (sp?), but decided for Cech.

My son sayd Brso won't play, so I included Ivica Olic instead.
Is he right?
</post>
<post author="MyOwnUsername" datetime="2004-06-11T23:47:00" id="p23">
I have Cech too <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"/>
Prso (not Brso) will play as far as I know - he had minor problems but I think he is playing.
Pletikosa is still doubtfull, and Juventus' Igor Tudor is not playing first game due to red card in qualifying game with Slovenia.

By the way, if you haven't made too much transfers so far, I would suggest Sokota instead of Olic - Prso, Sokota should be starters in forward, and even if Prso is not playing I belive Sokota will have better tournament then Olic - he plays in Portugal last few years, very popular there and I think he might be in great mood. And, especially against Switzerland he could be great. Against France we will not score at all so for this round put some non-Croats in team <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

But I think most of the fans have the same feeling with me.So disappointed.Portugal lost the first game and I don't have enough confidence to predict whether it can play better next few games.Hope it can.
Tonight,for every fans,is a football festival,because the "battle"between France and England will start.

Basically, you score points for predicting the results (not exact scores) of each match, and the person with the most points after the final has been played will be the winner.

Grand Duke, remember what I said, in another thread, about why I love to hate the English football team?

They proved that France is not the better side.
But they got Beckham and France got Zidane.
Beckham is like a paper baloon. He breaks into pieces at the decisive moments, when tension is too much.
Becks vs. Zizou. Bad vibes vs. good vibes.

----

MOU

I'm really sorry to say this, but Croatia, at least against Switzerland, looked like a pale, diffuminated bad copy of Croatia.
I still do sympathise with the team, but my expectations have been drastically lowered.

----

Portugal looked like a sharp copy of Portugal... in the 2002 World Cup.
All Greece had to do is to be orderly. It didn't impress me, either.

Spain was obviously superior to Russia. But, as usual, they have so much trouble scoring.

Now Italy is playing Denmark, and I'm at the office. Waaaaaah!

They sucked.
What upsets me is that they are not actually THAT terrible - I mean, few days against Euro they played friendly against Denmark, won 2-1 and played excellent game.
I said myself that they are far from WC'98 generation and that I don't think they can do anything spectacular here, but this against Switzerland was below all limits. Without offense to Swiss team of course. But we played terribly.

Maybe it's a bit because of the weather (although, of course, weather was bigger problem for Swiss), because if you think about it - of three games played in afternoon so far (in terribly hot weather), only Greece played really good. Croatia, Portugal and Switzerland were terrible, and Italy and Denmark just tiny bit better then terrible.

</quote>

Actually, no-one in Germany honestly believed, we could get a draw... or even win :wink:

<quote>
Despite an incredibly lethargic 'Oranje' display, Germany coach Rudi Voller says that Holland deserved their late equaliser.
Voller: "We were on top in the first half but after the break Holland put us under pressure and we could not get out enough to get the second goal that would have been decisive. But we can live with the result, they deserved their draw and it is not as bad as losing, from which it would have been hard to come back. Van Nistelrooy had only the one chance, we had kept him very quiet, but top players only need the one opening and they punish you. They were able to move up a gear in the second half and we just could not quite contain them for long enough. But it is not too bad for us. We can go into our next game against Latvia full of confidence. We watched them in the first half of their game with the Czechs and we know they are a good side, but we will be favourites."
</quote>

<quote>
Holland coach Dick Advocaat is also in agreement with his German counterpart that the 1-1 draw was the right result.
"Both sides had too much respect for each other in the first period, and that we could not get the ball up to our forwards enough. But we changed things after the break and had the link that meant we could get the ball to van Nistelrooy. He took his goal superbly, but then I always know what a good striker he is."
Regarding his tactical decision to field just one striker Advocaat continued: "I made the choices, they were made because we had studied our opponents and knew how we had to play against them. In fact our players had more problems with themselves than they did with the Germans, in the second half we were able to get the ball forward more and keep possession. It was the right result, a fair result because we played well and kept going forward looking for the equaliser. It was just that we equalised."
</quote>

<post author="koolplay" datetime="2004-06-16T06:43:00" id="p47">
But from the game,I think the draw score is the best result for the two teams.
The goal by Germans is a little lucky while the key goal by Van Nistelrooy is just his personal performance.
So as to our TV audiences,the game is not too bad and enough acceptable.

Brief comments about Germany - Netherlands.

Germany is the Fussball machine we all know. It has half only a talent (Ballack), yet the smart engine and the winning mentality are there.

Holland didn't show much. The German's were so cautious they didn't cross mid-field until the 9th minute of the game. Then, they realized this is no Clockwork Orange. Holland's only plus is that they have a new Van Basten.

Advocaat and Voeller both need a good deodorant.

Russia's out.
Only a (highly improbable) Russian victory against them in the next game will keep the Greeks from advancing.
This leaves one spot: it's either the hosts or Spain.

The Portuguese are still the more talented, but they didn't look good at all for a long while against a wounded and decimated Russian team.
My guess is a draw, and Spain advances (referees notwithstanding).

<post author="MyOwnUsername" datetime="2004-06-17T00:12:00" id="p55">
not only that fbaezer - even with losing against Russia Greece will probably go to quarter finals.
If Spain wins or Spain and Portugal play tie, Greeks can lose 9-0 if they want, they're still quarter-finalists.
And even if Portugal wins they can still go even with loss from Russia if their defeat was not to be higher then one of Spain (if they both lose 0-1, 1-2, 1-3, whatever...they are still better then Spain).

Only way that Greece don't go to quarter final is if they lose from Russia with bigger margin then Spain from Portugal.

Grand - funny thing is that France can still go out. If Switzerland wins against them, and either Croatia or England win, they go to next round (with winner of CRO-ENG game). Only tie in our game is not good for them.

As of our game - well...I am actually glad that French equalize, because if we won then draw would be enough for us, and when draw is enough for us we play most pathetic football ever - Otto Baric would send a team of three goalkeepers, and eight defenders to pitch and we would lose 8-0 with Rooney scoring all 8 goals <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

Now when we have to play best as we can, we have possibility <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>
I was actually hoping that England will destroy Switzerland (that kinda happened) and France will destroy us - so that England will go to pitch full of themselves because (only in football fortunately for you) England has typical Balkan mentality <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"/>

I am thinking of betting on England, only because I have this unbeliavable statistic of never guessing correctly when betting on games that involve Croatia - when I bet on them they lose from worst teams ever, when I bet against them they win against best teams ever (not only in football, but in all sports). So, if I put money on X2 (draw or win by England) you guys are doomed <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

Scotland/Croatia - England <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

"The Scottish sun" organized action in which their readers could choose which country Scots will support during Euro2004 - they have chosen "Balkan Bravehearts" as they call us - because of many similarities between Scotland and Croatia (and, OF COURSE, because we are playing England). Few scottish radio stations joined, and in many bars people are watching croatian games cheering loudly. Sport editor of Scottish Sun, Graham Donohue, is signing Euro2004 reports as Darko Bolokic and today, apparently, sport pages will go out as "Croatian Sun".

These are all Scots by the way:

It is no fun supporting France at a time like this. Even the Guardian cannot come up with a picture of Zinedine Zidane, who scored in the 20th minute last night to help his country beat Switzerland 3-1. (We do, however, learn from the French team's chef that escalope Viennese and pear and almond tart are among Zinedine's favourite dishes.)

No, it is all about the 18-year-old Wayne Rooney, who scored two of the goals in England's 4-2 defeat of Croatia last night. "Rooney is two good," enthuses the Star. "We're throo!" exclaims the Sun. ("Let's go all the Wayne!") "Heroo!" splashes the Mirror, in a headline perhaps a little too evocative of that talented bush kangaroo, Skippy. Sven-Goran Eriksson compared his protege to Pele.

"Rooney wielded both broadsword and rapier," the Telegraph murmurs admiringly, "harming Croatia with strong shot and deft touch. He terrified Croatia's defence, creating a deserved and welcome first for Paul Scholes, netting twice himself before admiring Frank Lampard's fourth from the bench."

"If there must be a cavil," writes the Guardian's Kevin McCarra, "it will lie with a defence pummelled into conceding goals."

The Sun's Shaun Custis is lost for words. "There are no words left to describe Wayne Rooney - the dictionary has run out," he tells readers. Custis has a curious exclusive concerning Rooney's tattoo. "His four-letter inking at the base of his back spells out 'Then'", he reveals. It seems the footballer and a friend had a catchphrase, "OK, then," when they were both living in the Merseyside suburb of Croxteth. At some point they decided to "make the mark permanent" by each having one half of the phrase tattooed on their backs.

"A kid is at our head like a Pied Piper," opines Oliver Holt in the Mirror. "We have spent too long in this country being crushed by the difference between expectation and reality..." Hold it right there.

<post author="MyOwnUsername" datetime="2004-06-22T08:51:00" id="p113">
yeah it could - difference here is that they have to play 2-2, 3-3, etc...to eliminate Italy. If they play 0-0 Denmark is out, if they play 1-1 Denmark is out if Italy beats Bulgaria 2-0 or more...only if they play 2-2 or any draw with even more goals they will eliminate Italy.

And as of other group, there is also possibility that Netherlands will be eliminated "unfairly", although everything will be completely legal. Czech Republic is already into next round and actually already winner of group, season was long, players are tired, and their coach already said that he will give rest to some of his best players.
They will certainly not let Germany win, but Germany will actually play Czech Republic "B" squad, and not the best team that beat Netherlands.
And you simply can't do anything with that - they called 23 players, all of them can play, and coach will use them....

The Rules for Euro 2004 are the same as those used in England in 1996 and Belgium/Holland in 2000:

if teams are tied on points at the end of the group stage, the teams are separated in the following manner - #1 being the first deciding criteria and #8 the last.

1. The highest number of points won Head to Head.
2. Goal difference between the teams.
3. The highest number of goals scored Head to Head.
4. Overall goal difference.
5. The best attack.
6. The team with the highest UEFA co-efficient - calculated on the results of matches in World Cup 2002 qualifying and Euro 2004 qualifying.
7. The team's ranking in the Fair Play indice.
8. A Ballot.

So, there are still options 7 and 8 to be considered as well :wink:

Totti was just as bad against a Danish player (who was lucky his foot wasn't on the ground, or his career would be over), and wasn't even given a yellow card.
Zambrotta made today a criminal tackle and the referee didn't even look.

Walter - I know that, but I thought that back at 1982 you were not living in BRD, but in DDR. I don't know where I got it.

fbaezer - Both Algeria and Albania. 1982 game you are talking about is against Algeria, but I believe Walter just mentioned biggest stories of german football, and once they were eliminated from final tournament (I think European championship) because of draw with Albania. Which is weak now, and was even more weaker then.

Very naughty McTag

Hope you are not inferring....

What I found funny was that before the match, an Italian journalist asked a Swedish fellow journalist what was Swedish for "fix"....Answer "There isn't really a word for it in Swedish, but I believe there are many in Italian"

Last nights match was one of the most dramatic I've ever seen except for Man Utd Bayern Munich in 1999.

When Italy scored that winning goal...and everyone knew apart from the players that it did not mean they go through... oh dear I almost felt sorry for them.

When they found out, one Italian player sat down on the 1/2 way line and refused to play anymore. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad"/> Reminded me of the Bayern player beating his hand on the turf at the end of the European Cup game. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/> <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

Congrats to nimh, rick and magnum.

How do you see the quarter-finals?
IMO, there's no clear favorite in any game, except France-Greece.

Portugal has home advantage, but -unlike what Kitchenpete thought at the beginning of this thread-, England has a very good side, the better one in this case. Had it not been for their loved "Becks", they'd be facing Greece.
(The better face of English football is Scholes, but tabloids think otherwise).

Greece is a team that can defend well, and Les Bleus have a sloppy defense, but in all other aspects, Greece is way inferior to France. The ball is round, but the Greeks are content with what they've achieved and I doubt they'll be able to pull out a miracle.

Sweden started great, but has slowed a bit since. On the contrary, the Netherlands has been player better and better. So the game is leveled and should be very interesting.

The Czech Republic will have their best players rested when facing Denmark. I think the spark of genius in the Czechs will probably make the difference between two balanced teams who know their assetts and liabilities.

I took a deep breath;Holland qualified at last.
Germans' poor goal ability made themselves out of the Euro Championships.
Czech gave Germans a lot of chances;if the Germans took one of them,now crying belongs to Netherlands.
But in my opinion,Holland should qualify the 1/4 finals while "old" Germans ought to be out of the tournament.
Now the 1/4 finals will be more exciting.
Most of the football fans will prefer the Holland because they plays more offensive than Germans,which can enjoy our fans more.

Well I'm feeling particulary jolly this morning. What shows character is not how you celebrate victory, but how you deal with defeat. [which probably explains why English people riot nowadays, that great English imperialist Kipling not being exactly PC]

If

by Rudyard Kipling

If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
But make allowance for their doubting too,
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream--and not make dreams your master,
If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same ;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breath a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
If all men count with you, but none too much,
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!

nah, you weren't. It's tough to lose the game this way (and if it was Croatia I am sure 99% of my compatriots would yell "We are robbed" too), but Terry commited foul. He did what is not allowed and fact that goal would be scored quite probably even without his "tackle" only means that he did stupid thing, not that ref was wrong. He put his arm around goalkeepers neck or over his shoulder, doesn't matter. You are not allowed to do that. Pretty simple thing.

I am, however, sorry that this game was quarter final game because I am sure some worse teams will enter semifinal - worse then both Portugal and England. But, that's how it always goes....

I am also surprised that England haven't used their own victory to learn something. Although we played bad against England, we also showed pretty obviusly how you end when you score early goal and then all you do is defend that lead.
Shots on goal statistic is something like 35-15 for Portugal - you can't win that way.

And, at the end, funniest thing is that worst players on the pitch were Figo and Beckham (Figo is terrible, absolute disaster, and Beckham was...well, better then Figo but nothing else). It's time for new stars to be promoted I believe.

Today: France-Greece. Although I would like Greece to surprise I doubt that it's possible. After all, despite all the fuss they actually played only one really good game - against Portugal. They lost with already eliminated Russia and were completely outclassed by Spain.

The Greeks were out for over an hour tonight, hooting and making noise! &lt;grins&gt;

(Of course, it coulda just been the two cars, driving around forever... heheh. I saw them pass by once, two guys laying belly-flat on top of the car while it was driving, all the while yelling and making noise. Last night, there were some too - Portuguese?

I supported Netherlands all along, but considering their beautiful penalty shots experience from WC98 and especially Euro2000, I thought that it would be cool if Sweden wins in shotout.

From the "Soccer Wars" thread, before the tournament:

<quote orig_author="Grand Duke">
Who do you fancy to win, Fbaezer? I'm going for a France-Holland final, with France edging it. England will be lucky to qualify from the group stages...
</quote>

Since the teams are so similar in power, Eurocup is almost a tossed coin (didn't Denmark get invited in the last minute and win?).

I can say neither Latvia, nor Greece, nor Switzerland, nor Bulgaria, nor Russia shall win.

I believe England will do better than expected (perhaps due to lower expectations), but not enough to win the tournament.
I haver never thought too highly of France, even if I like the way the play.
Italy will be a hard bone to swallow, but their system hardly ever pays all the way to the final.
Portugal has a edge (and it's a generation's last chance), but -seems to me- lacks mentality.
Spain gets too desperate in the bad moments (another case of excessive media hype).
Croatia is going through a generation change. Was very good, will be very good. Just not the right moment.

So that would leave Germany, Netherlands, Czech Republik and the surprising (for good or bad) Scandinavians.

After writing that, and just to make everyone mad, I'd say the Czechs are going to win.
And Nedved is better than Beckham <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"/>

MPs Condemn Soccer Tournament Referees

By Jamie Lyons, Political Correspondent, PA News

The referee blamed by some for dashing England’s Euro 2004 hopes today came under fire from MPs.

They have tabled a motion in the House of Commons criticising the quality of refereeing in the tournament.

It does not specifically mention Swiss referee Urs Meier, who disallowed Sol Campbell’s goal which would have put England through to the semi-finals.

But few will be in doubt the MPs had him in mind when they demanded the football authorities took action to stop bad refs ruining more games.

Yes. The Netherlands - as I always call it - has twelve provinces. Two are called South-Holland and North-Holland. For a long time they were the two most powerful provinces - although they used to be one back then - in the Netherlands, with cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. When people refer to 'Holland' they are not refering to the other provinces, especially not to the southern provinces Noord-Brabant (where I live) and Limburg.

I would recommend you to call it 'The Netherlands'. That's also the official name.

This is quite interesting:

<quote>
U.K. Agreement Regarding the Eligibility of International Players
The four home nations--England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland--entered an agreement in February, 1993 which set down the criteria for determining the international eligibility of players holding a British passport.

A player is eligible to play for one of the home countries if:

1. it is the country of his birth.

2. it is the country of birth of his natural mother or father.

3. it is the country of birth of one of his natural grandmothers or grandfathers.

A player who holds a current British passport but whose natural parents and natural grandparents were born outside the United Kingdom is eligible to play for the home country of his choice.

Referee under police protection

The Swiss referee who disallowed a goal by England in their Euro 2004 quarter-final with Portugal says he has been put under police protection.
Urs Meier told a Swiss radio station that he been advised to go into hiding after receiving death threats.

He has been accused by England's tabloid press of being responsible for the national team's defeat.

Mr Meier said he had received more than 16,000 e-mails after his address was printed in a newspaper.

Security problems

Mr Meier told Swiss Radio International that he stood by his decision on the goal, but that the public response had come as a shock.

"We have security problems in my office. We have security problems for myself and this is not the right way to handle this referee decision if it is right or not right," he said.

His house was tracked down by reporters from England's largest-circulation tabloid, the Sun, who planted an English flag outside it.

British MPs have also tabled a motion in the House of Commons criticising the quality of refereeing in the tournament, the Press Association news agency reported.

Mr Meier said he found the "overheated" reaction from the English media and fans hard to reconcile with the image he used to have of the country.

"I was always of the opinion that fair play in England is really important, and also the respect from the officials, but I never expected this reaction," he said.

"I hope that after the Euro and after some days, they forget something and I have my private life back."

one can't really comment on that Walter. I mean, if that ref really made terribly mistake against England it would still be completely retarded.

Especially when he actually made correct call. What pisses me off most are comments that this tackle would never be called in Premiership. Who the f*** cares? Football has its rules, and if you want to allow some things in your national championship then do it. But don't expect other refs to close their eyes on clear fouls.

And it was CLEAR FOUL.

But, England was known as bad loser, Netherlands surprised me. Now ref is "guilty" for them too. Fact that they had no chances during the match and if it wasn't for own goal they wouldn't have scored at all is probably not important <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

Some people are immune to all of this. The paper reported today that two of the country's newspapers, the Dutch Daily and the Reformed Daily, did not report on any soccer unless it was to do with side-effects on general social issues. These are the newspapers of the Bible Belt, where everyone votes Christian Union or State Reformed Party, where all the girls wear long skirts to the ankles, and where there are no professional soccer clubs, because those play on Sundays and Sunday is the day of the Lord. "Christians", the article reported, "do not indulge in sports infatuation".

You should always use the capital letter when using the adjective of a country.

So its British and Croatian. Just as it is Britain and Croatia. Never britain or british.

So

Ireland and Irish
Scotland and Scots (short form of Scottish people)
adjective is Scottish as in shortbread. (Walter knows this)

Though I'm not Scottish (adjective) myself, it annoys me when even English (adjective) people talk about the Scottish (wrongly used as a noun). It should be Scots. Or Scottish (adjective) people.

Thats 10 euros please. All major credit cards accepted.

WIMBLEDON DONT GET ME GOING ON TENNIS....Apart from admiring the physique of certain Russian lady tennis players, the rest of it can go to hell as far as I'm concerned. What is there to cheer about because a pampered upper middle class boy loses a match but still makes himself a load of money? Are we supposed to cheer because Henman wins £2 million and be disappointed because he only gets £1m? All these tennis stars are doing it purely for themselves. They even change nationality sometimes to get on the money circuit.

AND that Serena Williams hasn't got a body like that just through playing tennis. She looks like someone I know, and he works on a building site...and takes steroids as a hobby.

Well I started to reply saying this is easy...always capitals.

But then !!!

Certainly religions would have capital letters Christianity Judaism Islam etc

It would be seen as somewhat disrespectful to use the lower case, not only that but just wrong grammatically.

But adjectives as in christian name, jewish childhood etc I'm not so sure. I think I would always use capital, I dont think anyone would ever think it wrong. So Christian name Islamic society etc etc

My dear other points to "The Complete Plain Words" by Sir Ernest Gowers..page 238

<quote>
Several correspondents have asked me to say something about the use of capital letters. The difficulty is to know what to say. No one needs telling that capitals are used for the first letter in every sentence, for proper names and the names of the months and days and the titles of books and newspapers. The only difficulty is with words that are sometimes written with capitals and sometimes not. Here there can be no general rule; everyone must do what he thinks most fitting. But two pieces of advice may perhaps be given:

1. Use a capital for the particular and a small letter for the general. Thus:-

It is a street leading out of Oxford Street.
I have said something about this in Chapter 1. I shall have more to say in later chapters.
In this case the Judge went beyond a judge's proper functions.
Many parliaments have been modelled on our Parliament.

2. Whatever practice you adopt, be consistent throughout any document you are writing.

Thanks Steve and kitchenpete - what confused me is that in Croatian language there are differences - for example you would be "Britanac" or "Skot", but football player from Britain would be "britanski" nogometas.

Like: Croatia/Croatian/Croatian football, but in our language it would be: Hrvatska/Hrvat/hrvatski nogomet.

So, I knew that country and nationality go with capital letter, I was not sure with adjectives.

Well, i live downtown... and there's a lot of Greeks in this town, so both tonight and when they beat France there was a lot of shouting and hooting going on (still going on now, in fact, they're driving around in circles).

I couldn't explain the noise for Portugal the night after they reached the half finals, really - we dont have many Portuguese around here. But last night after we lost against Portugal, it was the Moroccans etc who were cheering and hooting about their victory - just their way of rebelling against us, I guess. That wasn't here though - that was down by the Amsterdamsestraatweg, where I ended up because of walking home with A.. Lots more Moroccans over there. Somebody shot off a bunch of fireworks down here tho - dunno if that was some happy Portuguese, or just some Dutchmen who had been planning to celebrate and now were left with surplus fireworks ;-)

But in general, yeah, I've been really surprised about all the celebrating going on. Few dull nights, no, heh. And thats not counting the blues festival, queen's day, the night before queen's day, the festival on the wharf, the gay midsummercanal festival... et cetera. All around the corner and around, here. I like it, but sometimes... &lt;grins&gt;

Oh, and I dont like it if they deal before my ****ing window... ass hole just now &lt;grumbles&gt;. ****in hell.

But overall, this is a cute, cosy, green little street &lt;nods&gt;. When I first moved to this town and found this street, I already thought, that'd be cool, to live there - it looks idyllic. Now I do, even if its in a cramped one-room apartment and on the "wrong" end of the street, on the ground floor right in front of where the teenagers hang out to smoke pot. Huh.

I received two messages from my sons.

Camus, 19, wrote: "Today football is in mourning. The team who played to not let the other play, the team who proposed not to propose, the team who wanted to tie won. Today football lost".

Patada Veloz, 23, wrote: "Greece plays horribly; they don't have a single player, a single one, who plays offensively. Only markers, game destroyers.
Bruckner failed too. He didn't pull Koller out. Smicer showed why he's a substitute in Liverpool. The others were fiercely marked by players who didn't let them breath. I'm sad. Football lost".

The best player, according to TV commentators here, was Seitaridis, the man who marked Baros.

Today is mourning,crying,disappointing,and an unbelievable tragedy for me as well as a lot of people who are in favour of Czech.
Czech was lost to Greece in the additional time.
Czech had more goal opportunities than Greece,but luckiness didnot stand by them.
Why?Can you tell me why?
In the 1/4 finals France was also defeated by Greece which had made me disappointed.
Maybe Greece had its unique way to win the game but it was far far beyond my expectation.
Nedved was doomed to be a miserable superstar;he had no chance to play in the final ascribed to many factors,such as injury,double yellow cards and so on.
Now I have nothing more to say just hope Nedved will feel better.
Final game will be the same two teams in the first game,Portugal vs Greece.
I hope Portugal,as the host,will laugh in the end.

I hate Greek kind of football, but I am glad Czechs are out and I hope they will never win anything.
I will never support them and they can play against Nazi Gorillas from Pluto and I will support Nazi Gorillas from Pluto.
Why? Because of Faroe Islands - Czech Republic qualifying game (I think it was qualifier for WC2002) - Czechs played poorly and it was 0-0, 88th or 89th minute...one Faroe player was injured (and he WAS injured, they are fishermen, waiters and bus drivers that play football for fun) and they kicked ball out of play. Retarded Czechs, however, haven't gave the ball back to them (which is basics of fair play and biggest rivals do that on every single game) but instead scored in few seconds while Faroe players were expecting them to be fair.

So, they can cry as much as they want. I don't care.

I found out yesterday that football in Greek is called "Podospheros".

A beautiful name: podos: foot, like in podologist; spheros: ball, sphere.

The one thing I like about Greece's victory is that podospheros had never given the Greeks anything, absolutely anything in exchange for their love of the game. Finally, the goddess Niké was at their side.

<post author="fbaezer" datetime="2004-07-02T12:34:00" id="p357">
Yes, "King Otto", Walter.

I have to admit that "King Otto" was, by far, the "best" coach in the cup, meaning the "most efficient".

He turned his team into "Zee Hellenic Fussball Machine". Disciplined, always keeping the tactical order, biting at every moment, with great stamina and athleticism. Some sort of Teutons with Mediterranean faces.

He also created one of the most boring teams in the history of football.

If I were Greek I wouldn't give a damn, because our national squad would be finally winning. But, alas, I'm not Greek, just a football fan who appreciates tactics, but truly enjoys when immagination, ambition and talent are displayed in the field.

From what I saw, what were the best games in this Eurocup?

Czech Republic - Netherlands
Portugal - England
Czech Republic - Denmark
Portugal - Netherlands
France - England
Czech Republic - Germany

What were the most boring games?

Greece - France
Sweden - Denmark
Croatia - Switzerland
Greece - Czech Republic
Greece - Spain
Germany - Latvia

It follows that the Czech Republic, Netherlands, Portugal and England proposed good games, and that Greece's best assett is their capacity of making all their rivals play bad.
That "King Otto's" making.

Who knows, perhaps Greece will, once more, put a trailer camp in their own area, hope that Portugal will get desperate, launch a modest counterattack, find a goal, build a thicker wall around their own area, and win the cup.

<post author="Walter Hinteler" datetime="2004-07-02T13:12:00" id="p358">
Well, I agree.

However, having a team with no real stars, with players, who even didn't actualy want to play national, he did the best in that situation: playing "old-style-Italian-football": defense, defense, defense and hoping for one fault of the others.
Thus, the Greeks have been the ultimate giant killers.

I think, Portugal will beat the Greeks..... but not only I've said, the French and Czech's would have done before, too. :wink:

I thought Ronaldo was being quite generous to Greece. The Greeks themselves were amazed to get to the final and actually can't believe they've won it! I don't think that proves the Greek team is the best in Europe, all it proves is that they won Euro 2004. If the same teams were in a league and played a whole season of games among themselves, very few people would expect Greece to end up league champions or even in the top half.

Final comments:

1. Boring final, specially the first half. Deserving winner. Most exciting moment: when the crazy guy who jumped into the field threw the Barsa shirt in Figo's face. Most heartwarming moment: to see Greece's prime minister, Karamanlis, cry of happiness.

2. Where are some of the Eurocup faded stars?

Totti went to the shrine of Our Lady of Devout Love, to ask for pardon and offer her the shirt he wore in the game against Denmark.

Koller is on his honeymoon. The too tall Czech forward married right before the cup. The press said his wife was weary, and wanted him back soon. Did his unconcious betray him in the key match against Greece?

This gives Mexican women some hope. Perhaps we can beat China, or draw, then lose against Germany by less than 8 goals, and get into quarter finals.

Brazil beat Australia 1-0. This means Brazil is not playing very good (the Australian girls were easily defeated by the Mexican squad in friendly preparation matches).

The big surprise is Japan beating Sweden.

There's footie in the Olympics too, you know. And dear Walter got a bit carried away with his girls' victory,

BTW, if you want to win a virtual medal, and don't lose money while betting, there's only one more day for entries in the A2K Fantasy Olympic Prediction Game:

Walter, good thing you reminded me about one of biggest shocks in world of football, just few days ago.
European Woman U-19 championship in Finland. In opening game Germany destroyed Spain 7-0...they continued in that style, humiliating all opponents all the way to semifinals where they had fun with Russia - 8:0.
Final against Spain. Same Spain they beat 7:0 in first game.

Result: Germany-Spain 1:2!
