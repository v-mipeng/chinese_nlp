Iranian terrorist blows off own leg after grenade rebounds in Bangkok

An Iranian terrorist carrying grenades blew off one of his legs and wounded four other people in a series of blasts in Bangkok.

The attacker was injured after lobbing a grenade at police which bounced back to him, said security forces.

He was staying with two other Iranians in a rented house in the Thai capital where police said they found more explosives. Possible targets were not immediately known.

Israel claimed the blasts were orchestrated by Iran. They came a day after Israeli diplomats were targeted in India and Georgia. Tehran denied the allegations.

Photographs showed the wounded man, named as Saeid Moradi, covered in dark soot on a pavement strewn with broken glass. He lay in front of a school with his head raised as if he was attempting to sit up or look around.

Hospital officials said Moradi’s right leg was severed below the knee. His left leg was intact but severely wounded.

The explosives were apparently detonated by accident, blowing off part of the roof of the house the men were living in. A second Iranian was arrested at Bangkok airport and a third is on the run, said police.

Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak claimed the Bangkok violence ‘proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to perpetrate terror’. A ministerial colleague said: ‘We know who carried out the terror attacks and Israel will settle the score with them.’

However, Thai government sources said ‘more analysis’ was needed to determine who was behind the attack and whether Iran was involved.

They launched a coule of attacks on Israeli embassies yesterday so I imagine this was meant to be a continuation of that. If it is Iran then this is very embarrassing for them.

we always thought the regime was trying to be smart and have "plausible deniability" by outsourcing and using proxies.... turns out iranians just suck at being terrorists.

In all seriousness, I'd wait for investigations to be completed. How stupid does a state sanctioned attack get when the agents are carrying iranian passports and iranian rials on them??? This sounds ridiculous. Especially considering how efficient they were at targeted assassinations of very high profile iranian dissidents all over Europe (Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Stockholm, Geneva).

Israel is the largest organised terrorist group on earth. I'm sure whilst they were busy accusing Iran they were also busy bulldozing homes, stealing land and claiming it as their own. I wouldn't be surprised if they are ultimately responsible for the bombings to gain sympathy. They've done much worse.

Probably justified when you realise that if iran get the bomb they have said they will use it to wipe israel off the map. The only other alternative is for military action against iran as just one nuclear explosion would wipe israel out. I happen to know most iranians despise their government, so the option israel is taking I fully support,because most iranians themselves are decent and I would be sad if there were iranian civilian casualities because of their terrorist government.

Its very very unlikely that Iran would use a nuke against Israel. It would be inviting complete utter devastation, and the one thing the Iranian leadership has shown is that their survival does matter to them. Their rhetoric is suicidal but their actions never match it.

Look up operation samson. Basically isreal are prepared to destroy the whole world if they are in a position where their own destruction is inevitable.
Isreal are a much bigger threat to world peace than iran.
Plus, you really think a nuclear iran would attack isreal??? They'd be crazy to even hover their hand over the red button.
Iran want nuclear weapons because of the position the west has put them in. They'd use the nukes as a bargaining chip but they would not be prepared to go to war.

You know how small israel is, if you were their PM would you take the risk?See thats the thing, we as a country do not have the vuneralbilities israel has. Iran is in bed with terrorists who would be more than willing to set a nuke off in israel given the opportunity.Israel is surrounded by nations who cannot stand them.The palestinians are only an excuse for these nations, arabs regard the pallys as the pikeys of the middle east.

Besides which I understand the israeli mentality, the jews got f'd over during the holocaust,no one came to their aid, and many jews privately think they went far too meekly to the gas chambers and the lime filled pits in the woods. So they said never again.

Yeah but Israel's size does not matter as they have second strike capacity. You could wipe Israel off the map and they could still strike back with their nuclear subs. As well as this if you nuke Israel Iran is going to be hit by nuclear fallout as well.

Yes Iran with nukes would be dangerous and there is a risk of a dirty bomb but I think to suggest that Iran would deliberatly launch an unprovoked nuclear attack on Israel is very unlikely.

Besides, the holocaust isn't an excuse for fundamental Zionism, although it may help to explain its rise it was already well under way before Hitler even came to power.

Furthermore, Arab leaders and particularly those before the Arab Spring (who were generally being paid off by the West) may have regarded the palestinians as"pikeys" but if you get to a grassroots level I think you'll find a lot of support for the Palestinian people, from Morocco to Pakistan.

The iranian leaders don't care one jot about israels second strike capability and what that would mean for them or their people. This is because they believe if there is a nuclear exchange and they are wiped out the prophet will walk the earth again. This isn't like the USA vs the Soviet union, we are not dealing with sane rational people.

Israel has never threatened to wipe any country off the map,unlike those who threaten it,whether that be terror groups or an actual country. They just want the right to protect themselves.

Sane and rational people? The Americans who developed the bomb, who are the only ones to have used the bomb in conflict and the Soviets-sane and rational men like Stalin? Murderer of countless millions? Of the unpredictable Kruschev and the militant Brezhnev?

Both nations who participated in numerous wars in an effort to expand their own influence and force the political future on others? Not a great comparison.

To assume that all those in power in Iran have a purely ultra religious viewpoint is wrong imo and I don't think much of its population shares those views either.

You cannot be sure that Israel are behind these attacks, they could well be, but you should be open to the alternatives. The Islamic Republic is facing some serious problems domestically, namely the fact that the Iranian people are waiting for the right moment to get rid off the regime, that has steadily since Khatami morphed into a multi faction conservative dictatorship. Only yesterday Tehran and other major cities in Iran were completely shut down with government security forces (they are very scared) along with the entire nation's internet connections in the last weeks to deter scheduled protests, and a repeat of the summer 2009 protests is waiting to happen sometime soon - with the potential to gather momentum and unseat the Islamic Republic (which has lost it's legitimacy in the eyes of the Iranian people). They have milked these attacks to try and stir up nationalistic feelings in Iran because a state of war is an excuse for domestic tyranny - read this blog <a href="http://azarmehr.blogspot.com/2011/08/assassination-of-iranian-academics.html">http://azarmehr.blogspot.com/2011/08...academics.html</a> The regime is scared and has resorted to beating up and jailing former presidents and senior figues in past administrations (like Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi), it was always a repressive system, but it is backed in the corner and it isn't clear what it is doing to hold onto power - especially given the whole thing is in a steady disintegration - with the conservatives (who are the only group that still has representation) fighting amongst themselves with the main faultline being the power struggle between the President and the Supreme Leader. It could well be Mossad, but I wouldn't jump to any conclusions.

They are looking for reasons to go into Iran. They went into Iraq to find Saddam's weapons of destruction, guess what? after spending all those years in Iraq, after ruining the lives of so many innocent people, they realised that there WERE NO WEAPONS OF DESTRUCTION. They went in to their country and robbed it of its resources. After the invasion of Afghanistan, the amount of heroin on our London streets has multiplied. So many people believe everything that the media feeds them. Stop being so naive. The truth is messed up but we must face it and realise that out government is no good, they are destroying the lives of millions.

According to the news, he had his other leg amputated above the knee and has been charged with attempted murder and attempted murder of a police officer. He's likely to go to prison in
Thailand, not a very charming prospect, so I think he'll be grateful to be given a painless suicide method, because that's the best future he can hope for now. And now the Iranians have denied involvement, they don't really want him to be able to talk about who was running him to toss bombs at innocent people.

Do you not get it? I'm telling you to not act as if Iran is more moral than Israel. Criticize Israel all you want, but when comparing the two don't ever act as if Israel is the sole oppressor, while Iran oppresses no-one. In most aspects Iran's government is far more brutal, discriminatory and oppressive than Israel's.

That last sentence is a load of nonsense. It's laughable to make such a comparison if you knew just a little of Israel's history.
I think it's brutal to have your home bulldozed in front of you then kicked out of your country don't you think? There has been systematic cleansing on a phenomenal scale in that region in the last 65 odd years. So when an Israeli politician cries about injustice well...

I know plenty about Israel's history. If you're intelligent enough you'll notice I'm not defending Israel or saying it's done nothing wrong. I'm merely pointing out that it is more humane than Iran and virtually all of its neighbouring Arab governments, e.g. Syria.

So is the cleansing of Arabs worse than the cleansing of religious minorities in Iran? Do a little research on Iran's government before spouting nonsense. Israel is often bad, but it is not the sole evil in the Middle East. I'm Middle Eastern myself, from Iran, and I can tell you there are bigger evils than Israel in the region.

The claim made by pro Israeli people is that if Iran get the bomb they will nuke Israel and MAD will not work becuase Iran want Imam Mahdi to return.

(TRhey said that if NK got the bomb they would nuke SK, well I am still waiting, all that has happened is that USA can no longer interfere with NK affairs, I know it is hard for the USA to keep its hands, feet and objects to itself but it is a good thing not to harass other nations.)

Well let me tell you if Iran nukes Israel and Israel nukes Iran then there will be no Syria, Jordan Israel or Iran (at the very least) possibly no Saudi, Iraq or Lebanon either.

Imam Mahdi won't be returning if Iran nukes Israel because his return is in Damascus which will be rubble and no people will survive the radiation.

Islam states the Imam will return in Damascus and will beocme the Imam of Damascus for 40 years before Jesus (Isa) returns.

So tell me who is Imam Mahdi going to lead if Damascus is rubble?

The real reason is IF Iran gets the nuclear bomb then the USA cannot play games and cause mischief in the persian gulf because it will be Iran who will dictate the rules and thats what the USA is scared off, they are scared that if Iran get the bomb then the USA cannot continue with the hegemony that has been created by USA and the bum licking sunni arabs dictators

Well then the Israelis aren't very good at "systematic Cleansing" because they seem to have accidentally allowed over two million Palestinians to become citizens of the state of Israel, with voting rights and members of parliament.
Lebanon and other arab coutnries prefers to keep them in disgusting camps and to deny them citizenship rights, but then I doubt you'll want to talk about that.

Do you think this 'achievement' is due to the mullah's managing? Iran's economy is one of the most backward in the world. It has the third largest oil reserves in the world yet it can't even make enough petrol for itself. The people of Iran rose for a democracy; not for a backward theocracy. After 40 years of new technologies oil extraction in a day still hasn't reached pre-revolution numbers, do you realise how stupid that sounds? The economy may be bigger but the standard of life definitely isn't. The mullahs turned Iran from a rising power to an economically-backward oil-dependent country, regardless of whether the Shah 'licked America's bum hole'.

It's not as if Iranians don't go abroad, it would have looked even more suspicious if he used a forged passport, so the terrorist using an Iranian passport doesn't mean much, he was an Iranian citizen after all, so he'd use an Iranian passport.

Iran isn't like the western nations where they can have a government that lacks knowledge on how to control people, if we had a pushover government we would have a new leader every week in Iran. For a powerful, rich and strong militant country we need to have a leader that can control the masses.

Don't get me wrong I don't like his methods but when people are rioting to have closer ties to the western nations, the same countries that are commiting actions of war against Iran and have corrupted our region (the middle east), the people should be stopped.

If you still believe the Shah was better let me put it this way, if the Shah ruled while the Iran-Iraq war we would've lost/surrended within a few months.

If either had the balls, tehy would have done it by now, insteda of 5 YNSC rounds of sanctions, Iran has long passed the point of no return and is more likely racing towards its first nuclear test.

It is very likely the the bomb is probably made or very nearly made, because for the past two years Iran has be testing the missiles upon which a nuclear warhead can be mounted, showing signs Iran is looking for a way to show the americans that it can deliver a nuclear bomb.

America or israle are helpless, don;t worry Irans regime isn't thick (or it would have collapsed by now) so it wont atatck isarel and put it out of existence, but iran will dismantle the USA built hegemony in the persian gulf.

I have family who were involved in the 1979 and the revolution was NOT about putting lunatic Mullahs in power. The Mullahs came to power due to a series of executions, elimination of opposition and most importantly the Iran/Iraq war where they used the distraction of war to take over the institutions of Iran and install their theocracy - interestingly your beloved Mullahs were helped to the hilt by Israel where from whom they bought around 1 billion dollars of weaponry and had a team of Israeli advisors situated just outside Tehran - as well as the Israeli bombing of Saddam's nuclear site. Twenty years ago, Iranians protested for change. Some were Islamic fundamentalists who wanted an Islamic government. Some other groups wanted a marxist country either one modeled after Moscow, i.e; Tudeh Party, or a a new form of Marxism, i.e; Fadayan and the Muhahedin wanted their version of Khmer Rouge in our land. However, in this national movement, overwhelming majority of people just wanted a more democratic and just government. They just wanted more say in the running of the country. They didn't desire the executions, the anarchy and definitely the war that followed. Unfortunately, revolutions are lead by radicals. Thus, the forces of Black and Red led the fervor. Tragically, our intellectuals handed them a green light. Bazargan, Foroohar, Sanjabi, and those others whom I barely know of, allowed Khomeini and his coalition of fundamentalists, communists and Mojahids swallow our country.

Regardless, the Islamic Republic will be replaced with a democracy soon, the Iranian people have had enough of the corruption, they have had enough of seeing their beautiful country being turned into a police state (just like Tehran was in the protests yesterday), they have had enough of their natural resources (i.e. oil) being sold to China for peanuts so Western corporations can obtain cheap oil, their national wealth being stolen by the likes of traitors like Rafsanjani, the IRGC and so on. They don't want these stupid Mullahs ruining Iran. A democratic, strong, wealthy and free Iran is on it's way.

1. Don’t support a regime that systematically uses rape and sexual assault regularly in its political prisons.

2. Open your eyes to the suffering of the lower classes that were promised prosperity after the revolution and have since only become poorer

3. Disapprove of, if not abhor, the disgusting ways of a lying, sick man like Ruhollah Khomeini.

4. Recognize how damaging the cultural revolution was to essential Iranian institutions by encouraging Iranians becoming less educated because it was more compatible with arbitrarily interpreted dogma

5. Realize that the Islamic Republic is built on LIES. Lies that have been uncovered and revealed for being lies. How dare you support a regime that’s constantly lying to our people? WTF is wrong with you?

6. Grieve the death of the thousands upon thousands of men, women and children ****ing children, for being executed without having committed any significant crimes. Those are Iranian children for ****s sake.

7. Acknowledge that Iran is a nation of diverse ethnic and religious traditions, that imposing a homogenized version of Sharia law is a great disservice to and suppresses beautiful diversity

And yeah, great talking Iran down there like the Iranian people are bunch of idiots who need to live in a police state or we will see anarchy. It is obvious Iran is ready for a democracy and political freedoms. Iranian people don't need to be "controlled" - the mullahs have replaced a beautiful and peaceful culture that has produced some of the greatest human achievements and supplanted it with misery and suffering. Both the Shah and the Mullahs are two peas from the same pod. Iran was in the process of becoming a secular democracy in 1953 when foreign powers cruelly ruined our political development, how dare you deny the Iranian people the opportunity to, even after brave martyrs like Neda have been gunned down, strive for self determination and freedom from the comfort and safety of the United Kingdom.

They didn't desire the executions, the anarchy and definitely the war that followed. Unfortunately, revolutions are lead by radicals. Thus, the forces of Black and Red led the fervor. Tragically, our intellectuals handed them a green light. Bazargan, Foroohar, Sanjabi, and those others whom I barely know of, allowed Khomeini and his coalition of fundamentalists, communists and Mojahids swallow our country.

Regardless, the Islamic Republic will be replaced with a democracy soon, the Iranian people have had enough of the corruption, they have had enough of seeing their beautiful country being turned into a police state (just like Tehran was in the protests yesterday), they have had enough of their natural resources (i.e. oil) being sold to China for peanuts so Western corporations can obtain cheap oil, their national wealth being stolen by the likes of traitors like Rafsanjani, the IRGC and so on. They don't want these stupid Mullahs ruining Iran. A democratic, strong, wealthy and free Iran is on it's way.

If Iran had the Shah in 1980 the Iran Iraq war would not have occured, it was a war instigated by america, who supplied both iraq and iran so they would kill each other and so that neither would be nore dominant in the region. It was america's revenge for the 79 revolution.

I'm not interested in talking to regime worshippers who choose to not live in Iran and probably aren't even Iranian. The Iranian people are not your puppets and they don't want to live in a police state just to please your fantasies about the world. You love the mullahs and the way they treat Iranians? Go and live there like my family do or stfu.

1. Don’t support a regime that systematically uses rape and sexual assault regularly in its political prisons.

2. Open your eyes to the suffering of the lower classes that were promised prosperity after the revolution and have since only become poorer

3. Disapprove of, if not abhor, the disgusting ways of a lying, sick man like Ruhollah Khomeini.

4. Recognize how damaging the cultural revolution was to essential Iranian institutions by encouraging Iranians becoming less educated because it was more compatible with arbitrarily interpreted dogma

5. Realize that the Islamic Republic is built on LIES. Lies that have been uncovered and revealed for being lies. How dare you support a regime that’s constantly lying to our people? WTF is wrong with you?

6. Grieve the death of the thousands upon thousands of men, women and children ****ing children, for being executed without having committed any significant crimes. Those are Iranian children for ****s sake.

7. Acknowledge that Iran is a nation of diverse ethnic and religious traditions, that imposing a homogenized version of Sharia law is a great disservice to and suppresses beautiful diversity

And yeah, great talking Iran down there like the Iranian people are bunch of idiots who need to live in a police state or we will see anarchy. It is obvious Iran is ready for a democracy and political freedoms. Iranian people don't need to be "controlled" - the mullahs have replaced a beautiful and peaceful culture that has produced some of the greatest human achievements and supplanted it with misery and suffering. Both the Shah and the Mullahs are two peas from the same pod. Iran was in the process of becoming a secular democracy in 1953 when foreign powers cruelly ruined our political development, how dare you deny the Iranian people the opportunity to, even after brave martyrs like Neda have been gunned down, strive for self determination and freedom from the comfort and safety of the United Kingdom.

The strongest point I wanted to make in my previous post was when I said I do not approve of his methods.
What it comes down to is that you can either have a leader that has the peoples interest at heart but is easily intimated and bullied by countries with equal or greater power OR we can have a government (dictator) that is horrid to his people that does not allow countries such as Saudi Arabia, USA and UK to penalise and exploit them. We don't live in a perfect world to have a government with the good aspects of both these different governments.
In this situation I pick the 2nd government, but we are both biased in our views.

I personally don't want to sit back while we are being taken for a dikhead by countries that can't even take care of their own people.

I am all for "standing up to America". But not if standing up to America means repressing the Iranian people. My political idol is Dr Mossadegh a man who was thrown out of office in a CIA/Royalist/Mullah coup precisely because he stood up for Iran and didn't sell out the country for the USA, Britain, China, religion or their own personal greedy gain like every single ruling faction that followed him proceeded to do. Iranians are not "content", only somebody who doesn't follow ANY news about Iran would know that, the whole of Tehran was shut down yesterday because of protests despite the threats from regime thugs.

I don't want a Western backed revolution, and nor do the Iranian people <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

What Iran needs to do is throw off these criminal Mullahs and nationalise it's oil &amp; gas (like Mossadegh tried to do) - ban all oil &amp; gas corporations from taking profits away from the Iranian - resist any form of imperialism as a nation and Iran could become a powerhouse economy - and pour the oil &amp; gas profits into building Iran from the ground up, and being a model state - and not pour oil/gas profits into the pockets of Rafsanjani, Exxon Mobil, BP or the China National Petroleum Corporation. Iran could absolutely become an economic powerhouse given it's position between Europe, India, Russia, the Arab World and China, the fact it is historically a tolerant and open society, it's history, it's natural resources, and the fact that it has a large and educated population. Shame all of that has been squandered over the years.

Powers like the USA want an Iran that does what they want. Whether it is democratic or not is an irrelevance - the key thing is the country behaves on x powers terms. That was what happened with Dr Mossadegh - he didn't behave how he was supposed to. Iranians have to accept this is the reality of the world and make sure we don't repeat the mistakes of the past by standing firm to outside pressure and attempts to engage in neo colonialisation.

Iran has a degree of power and wealth even as a basket case theocracy with huge levels of emigration, no political freedoms, being sanctioned by the West and drained of it's natural resources by the East and from it's corrupt leaders and government officials. If it is run properly then it would undoubtedly be a world power, as it historically has been for thousands of years. It has a very important location - close to India, China and Europe (as well as other emerging powers like Turkey) and has loads of natural resources (which has partly been a curse).

Nuclear weapons? I'm not sure we would really need them, I don't either oppose nor support them in a different Iran, it would depend on what I perceived the threat to Iran being. This regime isn't really standing up to the USA or Saudi in my opinion, if we had a democratic and legitimate government we could provide much better opposition, the economic might and the moral high ground to tell Iran's enemies to **** off. The current government has none of these, and hence provides an inadequate opposition to colonial powers. Nuclear weapons are not necessarily effective tools against outside forces, one only has to look at Pakistan to see that. I think you have to be pragmatic and do a cost benefit analysis, if they make sense then yes, if not, then no.

The Thai authorities have no reason to attempt to get them to provide false information, they aren't interested in the Iranian/Israeli penis waving contest but i can imagine very annoyed a group attempted to blow something up on their soil. They will verify any information given to them and if Iran are guilty something will come up linking them be it employment history, dental records, bank accounts ect chances are they will sing like mockingbirds just to avoid being sent back to Iran, can't imagine if Iran were behind these attacks them being best pleased with the three who messed it all up.

Google "Thai torture" and I'll let the countless amnesty and U.N reports do the answering for if they use torture (and most of those reports are about the military/police can't even imagine what the security agencies are willing to do)

I couldn't agree with your post more.

Iran is becoming a joke. The current regime is oppressive, and there is NOTHING democratic or Islamic about it. Almost every time I visit Iran a police car pulls up to tell me my headscarf is revealing too much of my hair, or that my KNEE length coat is too short. Or, for every finger you have nail polish on you are fined 1000 rials (~50p). But of course Allah would completely accept killing innocent people for no reason, or making the costs of living so high that people literally cannot afford food.

As Ferdowsi correctly states the rich are becoming richer and the poor are getting poorer. The standard of living is falling dramatically and it's ridiculous what the country has become.

Iran was a GREAT country, but the population of Iran is as intellectual, strong-willed and determined as ever. This is why there will be a revolution, and soon.

Yes. But either Ahmadinejad is stupid and did not realise how this would be interpreted by the west or he isn't and it was a deliberate comment designed to raise tensions.

The Thai authorities have no reason to attempt to get them to provide false information, they aren't interested in the Iranian/Israeli penis waving contest but i can imagine very annoyed a group attempted to blow something up on their soil. They will verify any information given to them and if Iran are guilty something will come up linking them be it employment history, dental records, bank accounts ect chances are they will sing like mockingbirds just to avoid being sent back to Iran, can't imagine if Iran were behind these attacks them being best pleased with the three who messed it all up.

Google "Thai torture" and I'll let the countless amnesty and U.N reports do the answering for if they use torture (and most of those reports are about the military/police can't even imagine what the security agencies are willing to do)

</quote>

Hmm, looking at the records it seems Thai police love torture even on petty crimes. Yeah, they'll probably look into the bank accounts etc. Thats probably the only effective way of convicting this man (and ultimately Iran) along with torture. But torture alone would not assure proof.

I couldn't agree with your post more.

Iran is becoming a joke. The current regime is oppressive, and there is NOTHING democratic or Islamic about it. Almost every time I visit Iran a police car pulls up to tell me my headscarf is revealing too much of my hair, or that my KNEE length coat is too short. Or, for every finger you have nail polish on you are fined 1000 tomans (~50p). But of course Allah would completely accept killing innocent people for no reason, or making the costs of living so high that people literally cannot afford food.

As Ferdowsi correctly states the rich are becoming richer and the poor are getting poorer. The standard of living is falling dramatically and it's ridiculous what the country has become.

Iran was a GREAT country, but the population of Iran is as intellectual, strong-willed and determined as ever. This is why there will be a revolution, and soon.

Detonating a nuclear bomb in Israel would cause death and destruction not just to Israeli Jews and Arabs, but also to the Palestinians, the people of Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and probably further afield. It would destroy some of the most holy sites in Islam, Christianity and Judaism and would ensure the destruction of Iran. It is not going to happen. The precise reasons are not clear - but it is a combination of increased regional power (i.e. a nuclear weapon gives you a larger voice), as an element of keeping the population of Iran suppressed and to invite Israeli airstrikes so as to rally nationalist sentiment to increase the levels of domestic support for a regime that is on very shaky foundations.

My understanding of it is that they want nuclear weapons to gain diplomatic immunity. They're using Israel as a scapegoat to gain support among the Islamic world as being at the forefront of the ideological clash against the West so they can be seen as heroes; which is definitely working with some, seeing the 'bum hole' people on this thread.

They want to maintain influence in the Middle East as a whole and (maybe) spread their religious dogma. They see the US and Israel as an obstacle hence to this which ties in nicely with their ideologically driven motives, hence the diddy-daddling between the factions.

I think the mullahs are both ideologically driven and have motives. They're using their core ideology to justify their actions but I guess the main reason is unknown to us all.

Haha, they are, surely you can see that.

For a start they don’t need a civil nuclear programme to power anything. Secondly, for the type and amounts of material they are known to be using and developing, that is way more than would be required for a civil programme as opposed to making nuclear weapons. All the indicators point to their ambitions to build weapons. If you look at today's announcement you can tell they are desperate to provoke some sort of confrontation, they are trying to be as provocative as possible - storming embassies, threatening to close the straits and sooo on.

No I'm not saying that, although I do realise that's why I implied. My point was that it's unfair that Iran should not be allowed nuclear weapons when other countries are.

Ever since ElBaradei left, IAEA (specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukiya_Amano">head</a> of IAEA) and the neocons have formed a loving relationship. Yukiya and ElBaradei are looking at the same information, yet ElBaradei did not conclude Iran had nuclear weapons nor did he conclude Iran had the "capacity" to. Yukiya, the opposite.

My point in my previous post is that America have already in a sense declared war with their actions because they are acts of war. Anyways in a war America and Israel do not stand a chance because despite what people say I do not think America's force is that great in fact I feel the UK has a much greater force than America and the UK is probably the only country that matches Iran's force.
We both different views on this issue as I personally feel that if Iran's enemy are allowed nuclear weapons so should Iran while your view is the complete opposite.

the fact is that irans nuke facilities are deep inside mountains and well protected and america can't do anything but apply sanctions which are not going to work.

An Iranian terrorist carrying grenades blew off one of his legs and wounded four other people in a series of blasts in Bangkok.

The attacker was injured after lobbing a grenade at police which bounced back to him, said security forces.

To Iran regarding the nuclear bomb:

BUILD BABY BUILD

The zionists are illegally building 'Jew only settlements' in palestinian lands. The zionists must be challenged and intimidated to make them stop their antics

SO IRAN: BUILD BABY BUILD and if the zionists continue to misbehave then BOMB BABY BOMB, UNLEASH FURY!
