<P>
Vietnam's government, in a brief reaction Tuesday to the death of former US
Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara, said only that he should rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
McNamara, key architect of the Vietnam War which he later came to describe as
"terribly wrong," died Monday at his home in Washington. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
"May he rest in peace," said Le Dung, spokesman for Vietnam's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, when asked for reaction by AFP. He had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
From 1961 to 1968, McNamara oversaw the escalation of United States' war in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The last American forces left Vietnam in 1973, and two years later the war ended
with Vietnam reunified. The war claimed more than 58,000 US soldiers, more than
three million Vietnamese from North and South Vietnam and around 1.5 million
Laotians and Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
The United States lifted a trade embargo on communist Vietnam in 1994 and
normalised diplomatic ties a year later, leading to growing economic and other
cooperation between the former adversaries.
</P>
<P>
But Vietnamese are still dying from unexploded ordnance left over from the war,
and Vietnam has blamed a spate of birth deformities on wartime use of herbicides
by US forces.
