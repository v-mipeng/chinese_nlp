Suspected communist guerrillas seized a passenger bus Wednesday then opened fire on pursuing government forces in a running gunbattle that killed at least four people in a province east of Manila.
</P>
<P>
At least five New People's Army rebels boarded the bus in Quezon province's San Francisco town after aborting a plan to attack its police station due to the presence of government security forces, regional military spokesman Generoso Bolina said.
</P>
<P>
When police learned of the rebel presence in the bus, they gave chase aboard a patrol car, firing warning shots as the guerrillas sporadically shot at them with rifles and pistols. The bus rammed through a wooden blockade set up by police, Bolina said.

<P>
The driver, a gun pointed at his head by one of the rebels, lost control of the bus before reaching a road blocked by army trucks in Quezon's Catanauan town. The bus smashed on a tree and three of the gunmen jumped out and fled, firing at troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
A fourth rebel was shot and killed by troops in the bus and another was captured. At least one passenger was wounded, Bolina said.
</P>
<P>
Three other people lay dead in the bus after the exchange of fire. Police investigators were trying to determine if the three, who included two women, were Maoist guerrillas or passengers.
</P>
<P>
"The passengers really got scared all along as gunshots rang out," Bolina told The Associated Press by telephone.

<P>
The Philippines' 41-year Marxist rebellion has been one of Asia's longest and bloodiest. More than 120,000 combatants and civilians have died in the rural-based rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Quezon, a mountainous province about 70 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Manila, has been the focus of intense counterinsurgency operations in recent years, forcing many rebels to move to other provinces, the military says.
</P>
<P>
President Benigno Aquino III has formed a negotiating team to resume peace talks with the guerrillas but sporadic fighting has continued.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks brokered by Norway have been suspended since 2004 after the rebels accused the government of instigating their inclusion on U.S. and European terrorist lists.
