BRONCOS '  DAWKINS RETURNS TO A CITY AND FANS HE CARED SO MUCH FOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PHILADELPHIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They would applaud the intensity from the upper
decks. And they would honor the consistency of performance from 6
feet under.
</P>
<P>
Dead or alive, Philly fans love Brian Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
"I've been blessed to sign -- I don't know if I should say
blessed -- but I've been asked to sign jerseys for people's loved
ones who died and want to be buried with one of my jerseys," said
Dawkins, who is in his first season as the Broncos' strong safety
after playing 13 years as a free safety for the Eagles. "I've been
booed, absolutely. But if you stay strong and persevere, Philly
fans will welcome you into their home."
</P>
<P>
And coffins. Take another second to think about this. Dawkins, a
man of deep faith and the courage to proclaim it, signing for the
dead.
</P>
<P>
"Many, many times," he said. "So I understand their psyche.
What Philly people want from their athletes is they want you to
care as much as they care."
</P>
<P>
After 13 seasons, seven Pro Bowls, a franchise-record 183 games
and 109 overall wins with the Eagles, Dawkins left Philadelphia for
a Broncos team that more strongly believed he could continue to
play at an elite level, if at a modified position.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dawkins returns to Philly, where the Broncos will
play the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field, a place that figures to
have its share of No. 20 jerseys sprinkled among the sold-out
crowd.
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will enter the game as considerable underdogs,
although in Dawkins there is hope. Maybe Dawkins, perhaps the
first-ever new kid on the block to immediately become leader of the
Dove Valley neighborhood, can inspire his Broncos teammates to
bring their "A" game today.
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't said too much about it," said Champ Bailey, the
Broncos' star cornerback. "I think he understands the importance
of this game for the team."
</P>
<P>
To Dawkins' credit, he has made sure his special moment doesn't
stray into distraction. His Philly-area home has been sold and, as
of Thursday evening, he still hadn't decided whether to fly his
wife, Connie, and four children out for the game.
</P>
<P>
His free hours at the team's hotel Saturday evening would not be
spent visiting with longtime friends. No disrespect. But there's a
reason why the NFL has an offseason.
</P>
<P>
Dawkins knows this game is bigger than him. His 8-6 Broncos have
slipped to a win-or- else AFC playoff predicament against a 10-4
Eagles team that has scored more points than the Indianapolis Colts
and already clinched an NFC playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a 'win one for the Gipper,' " Dawkins said. "We
need this game for us. Obviously, going back to where I grew up as
a professional player, I would love to win this game. But it's not
for anything other than the Denver Broncos need this game. Kyle
(Orton) needs this game. B-Marsh needs this game. I don't want guys
to think during this week I'm going to be more intense than I
already am for a game."
</P>
<P>
On the same day Dawkins was introduced at a news conference as
the Broncos' new safety, word spread of how Broncos coach Josh
McDaniels had engaged in preliminary trade discussions involving
star quarterback Jay Cutler.
</P>
<P>
It would be a while before Denver realized Feb. 28 was not a
dark day for bringing the eventual end to Cutler, but a glorious
day for marking the beginning of Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
Ryan McBean came to fully appreciate Dawkins' arrival during the
summer as the Broncos' 297-pound defensive end was horseback riding
along a trail near the famous Hollywood sign outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Among his riding group was a couple from Philly.
</P>
<P>
"We started talking about Dawkins," McBean said. "The more
they talked about it, the angrier they got. They started getting
mad at me. 'Why did you take Brian Dawkins?' Like I was the one
that brought him here. I was just smiling. And the lady gave me a
look like she wanted to kill (me). I had never heard of a player
having that much impact."
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, Philly fans are difficult to please. They get a
little tired of hearing about this, but too bad -- since that
December day 41 years ago when they angrily booed Santa Claus while
pelting him with snowballs, Philadelphia has lived with its
reputation as having the most irascible fandom in sports.
</P>
<P>
Local athletes think the Denver market is critical? Philly fans
booed their native son Kobe Bryant at the 2002 NBA All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
Name some of the all-time Philadelphia sports greats. Richie
Allen. Mike Schmidt. Donovan McNabb. Eric Lindros. They've all
suffered the wrath from their local faithful.
</P>
<P>
And yet, these same demanding Philly fans came to adore Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's because he played at a high level," said Broncos
running back Correll Buckhalter, who has his own homecoming week
stir after he spent the previous eight years as Dawkins' teammate
in Philly. "I mean, he's Hall of Fame-caliber."
</P>
<P>
No doubt, Dawkins' play is a major reason why he captured the
hearts from the City of Brotherly Love. In this way, Philadelphia
is like every other city -- fans aren't going to waste emotions
falling for backup blockers.
</P>
<P>
But as McNabb, the Eagles' quarterback, and Schmidt, the
Phillies' greatest slugger, can attest, Philly fans are acutely
aware of a player's intangibles.
</P>
<P>
"Brian plays every play like it is the last play," Eagles
coach Andy Reid said. "That's what you love about him."
</P>
<P>
Almost always, when a favorite player leaves via free agency,
which was how Dawkins wound up in Denver, the former team can feel
jilted. Resentful. It was different in Philly. One Eagles' employee
got fired for posting online his disappointment in the team for
allowing Dawkins to get away.
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are expected to make the classy gesture today of
introducing the Denver defensive players as part of their pregame
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
And Dawkins, whose remarkable, even frightening passion
translates to a seeming unconscious showmanship in the minutes
leading up to kickoff, will have been welcomed home.
</P>
<P>
"What I expect is a very, very loud atmosphere," Dawkins said.
"Because we appreciate one another. They're going to cheer me, I
believe, but probably not all. I know this, when the ball is
snapped, guess who they're going to root for?"
</P>
<P>
The team may always be Philly's true love. But from the graves
below and heavens above, Dawkins will not be without support.
