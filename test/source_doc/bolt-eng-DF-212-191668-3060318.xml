I am reading news articles, and they are saying things like the United States is on the verge of a financial meltdown not seen since the crash of '29..

Is this really the case? Is passing this planned 700b bailout really so important that if blocked will cause another depression?

Seeing as the Global Economy is still closely tied with the American Economy, what are the chances of another Depression like the 30's?

I see that McCain and Obama are politicizing this crisis, but is this crisis really that big?

There is lots of information out there, but there does not seem to be any concrete information and just how dangerous this situation is.

And if it is so dangerous, and the end of the financial world is ny, than why the hell is the American Congress thinking of blocking it??

i mean, I know that Socialism is a dirty word, but socializing 700b worth of debt to stave off another depression seems like a worthy cause to tread down the dirty path.

I believe everyone agree on some sort of bail-out (i should say there is a concensous) because i dont believe in it, but i think the problem is that they do not agree on the terms, Bush is for getting the money and adding oversight later, it's very dangerous business writing the government a blank check.

where is the money going? who will benifit? what is the best way to spend it, will this really work? is this just a primer? are we going to have to invest more? should we really protect stock holders? do we take over the debts or just back them? Is this bailout going to lead to other bail outs?

these are all questions that need to be debated before a real solution can come to fruition.

It's bad, but this might make it worse.

The Chinese SSE (Shanghai Stock Exchange) has shed 50% over the last several months. It seems to be reacting directly to crises in the US financial sector. It's at about 2300 now, compared to a yearly highly of about 6400.

It was overvalued and riding its own bubble for many reasons not related to the US (e.g., the lack of exchange rate risk). That isn't to say that it's not reacting the US financial sector crisis, but be careful in attaching too much to it.

If you want to sell newspapers, go big on the story.

If you want to get re-elected, make sure that you go big on showing you're saving the day, whether it's on the side of preventing bigger government or preventing contagion.

I have been listening and watching foreign channels including the US ones.

Even Lord Lamont alluded to 'crony capitalism'.

What is that?

Also, they have spoken that the bail out should not give any windfall assistance to the executive. How will that be cranked in?

if they're going to do something, then what they ought to do is make loans, which the financial institutions have to repay with interest. And if you think -- that's an idea which the Chileans have used in a bigger crisis than this for them in 1982, and it worked for them. People paid back the loans. They weren't allowed to pay dividends until they repaid the loans. They weren't allowed to take bonuses until they repaid the loans. I think that's the way -- if we're going to do this, then that's the way we should do it.
