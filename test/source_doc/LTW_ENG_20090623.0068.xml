Kroger Stocks Profits in Tough Grocery Market

The mother of two teens is price-sensitive and likes a broad selection
of goods. She buys house brands and private-label products.

"I shop here because there is more choice and better prices," Sablock
said as she dropped a box of Ralphs brand instant oatmeal into her cart last
week.
</P>
<P>
Times are tough for neighborhood supermarkets as cost-conscious
consumers defect to Wal-Mart, Costco and other discounters. But Kroger Co.,
owner of the Ralphs and Food 4 Less chains, seems to be bucking that
trend.
</P>
<P>
Kroger posted same-store sales growth of 5 percent in the latest fiscal
year. That compares with growth of less than 1 percent for Vons parent
Safeway and a 1.2 percent decline for Supervalu Inc., parent company of
Albertsons (excluding fuel sales for all three).
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the Cincinnati-based Kroger's success probably is
tied to its efforts to attract bargain hunters, aided by its exhaustive
electronic tracking of customers' shopping patterns and a push into
marketing house brands.
</P>
<P>
"Kroger is the best-positioned traditional food retailer in a weak
economic environment based on its aggressive pricing and strong market-share
positions," said Joseph Agnese, a Standard &amp; Poor's equity
analyst.
</P>
<P>
Much of Kroger's recent success is attributed to a tracking system that
identifies how often shoppers visit the store and provides the company with
detailed information about what they buy, Kroger Chief Executive David B.
Dillon said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Developed by Dunnhumby, a British marketing company that also is working
in the United States with the Macy's department store chain, the system
gives Kroger clues as to what types of promotions and specials will draw
people back into its stores.
</P>
<P>
"We send our very best customers coupon books specifically targeted at
what they actually buy. The redemption rate of these coupons is
significantly higher than other coupons," Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
Kroger uses the data to divide the stores of most of its chains into
three tiers, and stock them accordingly. The upscale Ralphs store, for
example, will have a larger wine selection and won't offer the lowest price
"Value" private-label goods. A mainstream Ralphs will have a broad mix of
goods at varying prices points, while the value store "will be much more
focused on price," Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
The system allows Kroger to identify which items matter most to
customers when it comes to price and prevents the company from discounting
products that would sell at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 2,500 stores in 31 states, Kroger is the nation's largest
grocery company. It operates under two dozen local banner names, including
Ralphs and Food 4 Less in Southern California, Fred Meyer in the Pacific
Northwest, Food 4 Less in Chicago, Fry's Food and Drug in Arizona and Kroger
in Ohio, the Midwest and much of the South. The company also owns 385
jewelry stores.
</P>
<P>
Kroger has proved especially adept at operating in regions where
Wal-Mart's supercenters have captured large market shares, analysts say.
Last year, Kroger's share grew almost a full percentage point in regions
where Wal-Mart is no less than the No. 3 seller of groceries.
</P>
<P>
It could be nothing more than Kroger's giant size and reach "allowing it
to be the last man standing," said Jim Prevor, editor in chief of
PerishablePundit.com, a food-industry Web site. "Wal-Mart comes in and
destroys the independents but doesn't get all of that share. Kroger gets a
slice, too."
</P>
<P>
Kroger has benefited from shoppers turning to private-labels goods to
save money, said Andrew Wolf, an analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets in
Richmond, Va. Private labels are now a $12.5 billion annual business at
Kroger.
</P>
<P>
Kroger's house brands typically have a higher profit margin than the
national labels. The shift by consumers to less-expensive but higher-margin
private-label goods is reflected in Kroger's financial results, Agnese said.
Profits rose 8 percent to $349.2 million in the quarter ended Jan. 31, even
though sales grew less than 1 percent to $17.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
"Profits are the outcome of focusing on the customer," Dillon
said.
</P>

<P>
Ralphs, held back by the bitter 2003-04 grocery workers strike and
lockout and payment of $70 million in fines and restitution for violating
federal labor laws during the labor dispute, is just now hitting the stride
of other Kroger divisions.
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of it was really hard. We needed to get everyone focused
back on the business, and we started out slow. Some of our associates and
some of our managers did not have the right attitude to help us come back,"
Dillon said.
</P>
<P>
Dillon likes the progress both Kroger and Ralphs have made but noted
that competition only grows tougher as nontraditional grocery retailers such
as Target and CVS devote more space for food.
</P>
<P>
The best way to meet that competition is to keep Kroger focused on its
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago we paid too much attention -- almost every day -- looking
at what our competition was doing," he said. "We can't ignore our
competitors, but we have to pay more attention to what our customers want in
our stores."
