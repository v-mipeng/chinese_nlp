Earthquake anyone?

A few minutes ago Rod asked, "Do you feel that?" I asked what. He said, The shaking can you feel it. Look even my glass of tea is shaking.

Weird things happen I did not feel it. So I looked to see if there has been any earthquakes lately. I found that california has has 3 in the last hour of about a <a href="http://quake.usgs.gov/recenteqs/">3 on the scale</a>. <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/eqinthenews/2009/us2009bpba/">Magnitude 3.0 GREATER NEW YORK AREA, NEW JERSEY February 03, 2009, Magnitude 4.5 SEATTLE-TACOMA URBAN AREA, WASHINGTON January 30, 2009, Magnitude MW 5.8 SOUTHERN ALASKA January 24, 2009 Magnitude 4.5 GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA, CALIFORNIA January 09, 2009 Magnitude 6.1 COSTA RICA January 08, 2009 and so on.</a>

The last big earthquake in the midwest was devastating.

<quote>
<a href="http://mediacaffeine.com/perspectives/environmental/earthquake-preparation-in-midwest/">Scientists Warn of Devastating Earthquake in the Midwest</a> "When you ask someone where the next catastrophic earthquake will hit in the United States, almost everyone would say California. Warnings of the big one have been in circulation for a while, from movies to government programs - everyone knows that California is the most likely spot for an earthquake disaster.

According to FEMA, everyone may be wrong.

From San Francisco down to Los Angeles, preparations have been made and are continuing to be made to increase the safety and awareness in the likely event of a major earthquake in the near future. FEMAs concern now shifts towards Missouri and the surrounding states where a hotbed of earthquake activity is surrounded by populated areas that are currenly unprepared for a major earthquake.

They should be, as two of the strongest earthquakes in American history happened there and is likely to have a repeat soon.

Recently FEMA issued a statement that this concern must be addressed more seriously. To put this into perspective, the area of impact of the zones 1895 earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 was 7X greater than that of the 1994 Northridge, CA, quake of approximately the same magnitude. Future earthquakes in the area have the potential to be much stronger than that."

probably has to do with the "Ring of Fire" since they think those volcano's might go in Yellowstone and Alaska and probably other places.

Same fault line. California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska share that fault line. If there was a major shift all our volcanoes will go, possibly even all at once. Or on the reverse, if they all went at the same time there would be a major shift. It's the root of the "big one" that people fear on this coast.

Last big earthquake I was in was in California. We lived in the mountains. My parents had bought a flooded home. One whole end of the house was up on stilts. They had it up about ten feet while fixing where the flood had washed out the underneath of one end of the house. It was early in the morning and I woke up to my bed rolling across the room.

Thinking it was just a strange dream thought no more of it until my brother came into the house. He slept out in the travel trailer. He was very mad. He said, "Who was shaking the trailer". All the pots and pans had fell out of the cupboards and one had nailed him. He thought it was me shaking the trailer to pester him until he heard it was an earthquake.

No more damge done to the house though. It floated on the stilts. It faired better than a stiff foundation would have. It was a 6.8.

New Madrid Earthquake was one of the most powerful ever recorded. The Missippi River according to some eye witnesse ran backwards for three days.

I remember reading that there are several thousand earthquales every day not counting those of volcanic origin most however are less than two on the richter scale.

Ummmm...... Do you mean from the volcano, or Alaska in general? Volcanos ussually do not produce big quakes, that is, greater than 6.5. However, the Alaskan subduction zone definately produces some whoppers. 9+.

No, they do not share the same fault line. Not even the same plate causes the subduction zones. The San Andreas is a slip-strike fault between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate. The subduction zone that causes the huge quakes from Cape Mendecino to Vancouver Island is the Cascadia Subduction Zone, where the Juan de Fuca plate subducts beneath Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and Southern British Columbia. The quakes in Alaska are caused by the Pacific Plate subducting beneath Alaska.

Yup and there are plates/pictures accounted for of some of the damage done. I am sure if you are interested you can find them.

This earthquake caused 28 fatalities and about $11 million in damage to highways and timber. It is characterized by extensive fault scarps, subsidence and uplift, a massive landslide, and a seiche in Hebgen Lake. A maximum MM intensity X was assigned to the fault scarps in the epicentral area. The instrumental epicenter lies within the region of surface faulting. Area of perceptibility, maximum intensity, and Richter magnitude all were larger for this earthquake than for any earlier earthquake on record in Montana (from May 1869).

At 9PM on January 26, 1700 one of the world's largest earthquakes occurred along the west coast of North America. The undersea Cascadia thrust fault ruptured along a 1000 km length, from mid Vancouver Island to northern California in a great earthquake, producing tremendous shaking and a huge tsunami that swept across the Pacific. The Cascadia fault is the boundary between two of the Earth's tectonic plates: the smaller offshore Juan de Fuca plate that is sliding under the much larger North American plate.......... The earthquake shaking collapsed houses of the Cowichan people on Vancouver Island and caused numerous landslides. The shaking was so violent that people could not stand and so prolonged that it made them sick. On the west coast of Vancouver Island, the tsunami completely destroyed the winter village of the Pachena Bay people with no survivors. These events are recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. The tsunami swept across the Pacific also causing destruction along the Pacific coast of Japan. It is the accurate descriptions of the tsunami and the accurate time keeping by the Japanese that allows us to confidently know the size and exact time of this great earthquake.
