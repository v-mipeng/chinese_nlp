' LAST-EMPRESS ' : WARTIME CHINA ' S ELEGANT ENIGMA

"The only thing Oriental about me," Soong Mei-ling once wrote,
"is my face."
</P>
<P>
Soong Mei-ling, better known to history as Mme. Chiang Kai-shek,
was exaggerating only slightly. Chinese by birth, American by
education and cultural inclination, she was a seductive blend of
both societies; for a time, no woman in the world was more
powerful.
</P>
<P>
Chiang led a long, vastly complicated life, one that is richly
detailed in "The Last Empress," Hannah Pakula's long, vastly
complicated new biography. Pakula's book is a yeoman work of
historical research, with fact grinding against fact. It is also a
monotonous piece of storytelling, one that has little pliancy or
narrative push. Its 681 pages of text are at times as grueling as a
forced march across the Mongolian steppe.
</P>
<P>
The story of Chiang's life has lost none of its strange, piquant
appeal, however. Born in Shanghai in 1898, she was the daughter of
a peasant who had gone to America at age 12 and found work on ships
and in printing shops. Her father, Charlie Soong, eventually
graduated from Vanderbilt University and returned to China at 20,
where he had six children and became rich publishing Bibles. He
raised Soong Mei-ling and her siblings to appreciate almost
everything Western, including mattresses (soft), food (American)
and religion (Methodist).
</P>
<P>
Cutting against the grain of a staunchly patriarchal society,
Soong expected big things from his daughters as well as from his
sons. Soong Mei-ling's two older sisters traveled to the United
States to attend Wesleyan Female College in Macon, Ga.
Soong-Mei-ling arrived in America at age 10, studying at a boarding
school in New Jersey and a public school in Georgia before
graduating from Wellesley College.
</P>
<P>
When she arrived at Wellesley in 1913, Pakula writes, Soong
Mei-ling could lay on a "Scarlett O'Hara accent" she'd picked up
in Georgia. ("Ah reckon Ah shan't stay aroun' much longer," she
reportedly told the freshman dean.) She was also, Pakula writes,
"short, chubby, round-faced and childish in appearance, with a
short haircut and bangs over her eyes that did nothing for her
looks."
</P>
<P>
By the time she left Wellesley, however, there was a sense of
destiny about Soong Mei-ling. "She had not been given a Western
education," Pakula observes, "in order to spend her afternoons at
the mah-jongg table."
</P>
<P>
The Soong sisters married well. One, Soong Qing-ling, married
Sun Yat-sen, China's first president after the last emperor was
overthrown in 1911. In a lavish ceremony in 1927, Soong Mei-ling
married one of Sun's former military aides, Chiang Kai-shek, a man
who would become the head of the Nationalist government in China
from 1928 to 1949, and later its leader while in exile in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He was a hardened soldier who "dressed simply in a plain cotton
uniform with straw sandals," Pakula writes, and neither drank nor
smoked. Chiang was by now thin, glamorous and wore form-fitting
clothes. Barely 5 feet tall, she had, Pakula declares, "a
near-hypnotic effect on men."
</P>
<P>
Because Chiang Kai-shek spoke virtually no English, Chiang
became his de facto translator and the face China turned to the
Western world. She wrote articles about China for The New York
Times Magazine and The Atlantic Monthly in the early '40s. She
appeared on "Meet the Press" in 1958. She was Chiang's closest
adviser and she constantly buffed his -- and the country's -- rough
edges.
</P>
<P>
The pair were seen as a modernizing influence in China; Time
magazine named them Man and Woman of the Year in 1938. The peak of
Chiang's fame arrived in 1943, when she toured America in support
of the Nationalist Chinese cause against Japan.
</P>
<P>
During that tour she was the first private citizen to address
the Senate and the House of Representatives, and in Los Angeles she
gave a speech to a packed Hollywood Bowl. (While in America, Pakula
suggests, Chiang continued a romantic involvement she had begun
earlier with Wendell Willkie, the Republican who had lost the 1940
election to Franklin D. Roosevelt.)
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek's government, increasingly besieged by China's
Communist Party as the 1940s went on, was also rotting from within.
He was a ruthless, petty man and a dismal leader. As Theodore H.
White and Annalee Jacoby observed, "The manners of the
Kuomintang" -- the Nationalist Party -- "in public were perfect;
its only faults were that its leadership was corrupt, its secret
police merciless, its promises lies, and its daily diet the blood
and tears of the people of China."
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Roosevelt got a chilling glimpse of Chiang's own dark
side when Roosevelt asked her how she would deal with a difficult
labor leader like John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers. "She
never said a word," Roosevelt wrote, "but the beautiful, small
hand came up and slid across her throat."
</P>
<P>
Chiang Kai-shek and his wife were forced into exile in Taiwan
after the Communist victory in 1949; he presided for decades over
Nationalist politics from there. After his death, in 1975, Chiang
moved to New York City, where she led a reclusive life, dying in
2003 at 105. She had no children. Her husband had contracted
venereal disease before their marriage, Pakula writes, and was
probably sterile.
</P>
<P>
"The Last Empress" bogs down in overly long discursions into
the intricacies of China's political history. Indeed, Chiang's own
story often recedes far into the background. But Pakula's book
comes alive in its pepperings of telling detail about Chiang's
chaotic life.
</P>
<P>
Pakula notes the way Chiang loved to deploy esoteric words
("indehiscence," "ochlocracy") in her speeches in English,
sending reporters scrambling for their dictionaries. She observes
that President Harry S. Truman, tired of Chiang's appeals for
money, began to refer to her husband as "Cash My-check."
</P>
<P>
She details Chiang's final years at 10 Gracie Square, an elegant
apartment building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. There she
kept three dogs (two bichons and a Yorkshire terrier) and employed
24 servants. There were reports that neighbors complained about the
cooking odors and cockroaches in her 18-room apartment, and that
Chiang kept a closet filled with gold bars.
</P>
<P>
Pakula is also the author of "The Last Romantic: A Biography of
Queen Marie of Roumania" (1985) and "An Uncommon Woman: The
Empress Frederick: Daughter of Queen Victoria, Wife of the Crown
Prince of Prussia, Mother of Kaiser Wilhelm" (1997). She views
Chiang's life with interest and occasionally, when warranted, with
sympathy. She is clearly in agreement with Eleanor Roosevelt, who
summed up Chiang's striding performance on the world stage by
remarking that while she could "talk beautifully about
democracy," she did "not know how to live democracy."
