22 hrs. that's rough. i believe the flight from guam to oz is about 4.5 to 5 hrs. maybe more depending on where you end up landing.

Sydney, of course - it's the place most people fly into, anyway! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz"/>

Perhaps we can tempt Gautam if it's when the Indians are playing Oz in cricket - he'd absolutely be in his element. That makes it December 2003 - January 2004. The next time India plays in Australia is 2007-2008!

My fear of flying is beyond comprehension. But I had to fly to Japan, March AFB near Sacramento, CA via Seattle, WA. I forget how many hours we were in the air but it was a long time. It was a MAC flight and jam packed and then when we got to Tokyo we had to land in the remnants of Typhoon Trix. Yikes, I thought I would die. After that I did not fly for 25 years.

Finally it was just so inconvenient I went to a destination training program in 1988-89. Since then I have flown six times and once by myself. Four of these flights were transcontinental. I was simply trained to deal with flying. I will never enjoy it but I do it so I can go long distances in short time frames. I would fly to Australia in a heart beat to see our friends there.

Right Heeven and I look like my avatar too.

I suggested January 2004 because that's the most likely time to attract Gautam (unless you're other than a female or....)

Let's face it, Deb - none of these people could even fly in to Adelaide, unless they come through Sydney (or Melbourne)! Except via Asia? or Perth? and, why would you?

Yesterday was very hot, but today is just brilliant - and it's Friday, which makes it even better!

Well - it depends on what you mean by guiding?

As I'm sure you know, Australia is as big as mainland USA, but without the population. Most people live in the cities, mainly along the south-east quarter.

I can make suggestions, but you have to give me an idea of what you have in mind.

Questions to ponder:

How long will you be here?

What time of year?

What do you want to see? Cities, wildlife, outback?

The Oz A2K'ers all live in different cities (with the exception of Mr Stillwater, who apparently lives in Sydney, but so do 4.5 million others!)

And, of course, the biggie - money.

If you want to see a variety - you need to factor in the cost of internal flights - flying is really the only way to cover the distances.
Check out:
<a href="http://www.qantas.com.au">www.qantas.com.au</a>
<a href="http://www.virginblue.com.au">www.virginblue.com.au</a>
<a href="http://www.regionalexpress.com.au">www.regionalexpress.com.au</a>

These are the main airlines that operate in the domestic sector. Qantas apparently have such a thing as a boomerang pass, which also may be checking out.

For a good travel forum on Australia (that I frequent) try fodors.com.au - forums, Australia.

I look forward to some more detail from you

Greetings from Blighty! Whatever that means. Hello to all Australian chums!

My knowledge of Oz is limited to Sir Les Patterson and Kiri te Kanawa.

Only joking of course. But these are both wonderful people.

Did you know that 5 or 6 of us are going to have an A2K meet in London at the end of the month? I'm looking forward to that. And my pal, who is richer than me, is going to Perth, Oz next month for a hol! Lucky beggar.

G'day McTag - thanks for dropping by!

We'll throw another snag on the bbq for you!

You've put on the A2K London meet too early - there's a slight chance I'll be there in early June - unless someone sends me tickets for Wimbledon, in which case, I'll be there late June!

Oz must be really cheap for Poms! (except in the cricket, football heartbreak departments!). You get roughly $3 Oz to every Pom pound. And things cost about the same in pounds in England as they do in dollars in Oz. So, something that costs 10 pounds there will be $10 here, roughly.

Get yourself organised and get out here. And the weather is good, even in winter!

Christmas in OZ would be a fun thing for me. Leaving the cold weather here for your summer would be nice.

I might be able to consider it if 1) it's during the holidays (Christmas-New Years), and 2) the airfare is 'reasonable.' <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"/>

Well, Christmas time would give all you northerners a different taste of how Christmas is: beach, sand, heat and mangoes running down your chin! And December / January is great fun in Sydney - lots to see and do in the Festival of Sydney. Hot, humid and may be a tad rainy, though! Very hot and humid on the Barrier Reef.

Don't count on my organising ability - it's non existent! I drive within a kilometre of Wilso's place about once a month, and still can't organise myself to meet him! Soon!

I wouldn't count on reasonable fares, though - Christmas is high season everywhere. And it's certainly high season in Oz. It's our main holiday period. No hotel deals (or not many - unless you can afford to stay 5 star!) Even casual travellers like me wouldn't dream of going anywhere without a bed booked for the night - and I seldom book anything (too disorganised! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused"/> )

Waiting and watching...........
