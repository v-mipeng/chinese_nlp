WASHINGTON -- The nation's largest health insurance carrier is urging its
employees to lobby the Senate against reform proposals that would hurt the
firm's bottom line, according to copies of e-mails released Thursday by a
liberal advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
UnitedHealth Group, which is based in Minnesota, e-mailed its 75,000
employees on Tuesday, asking them to write their senators and local
newspapers in opposition to a public insurance option, alleging that
"government-run health care" will force "millions of Americans" to drop
their current coverage.
</P>
<P>
Proposed form letters from the company also lay out opposition to cuts
in the costly Medicare Advantage program and advocate higher financial
penalties for individuals who do not buy health insurance. The e-mail was
sent by United for Health Reform, the name of the company's lobbying arm;
the subject line read: "Write Your Senators!"
</P>
<P>
Consumer Watchdog, the California-based advocacy group which obtained
the documents, says the letters are full of misleading GOP talking points,
such as the claim that millions will lose coverage. The group also says the
campaign amounts to intimidation of employees of UnitedHealth Group and its
main operating division, UnitedHealthcare.

<P>
"No UnitedHealthcare employee would modify the lobbying letter to favor
Medicare-for-All, or even a modest public option, knowing that his or her
managers may be reading that e-mail," said Judy Dugan, Consumer Watchdog's
research director. "They wouldn't dare to speak against the company position
unless they've already got a new job lined up."
</P>
<P>
UnitedHealth officials strongly disputed the intimidation allegation,
noting that the e-mail called the letter-writing campaign "completely
voluntary."
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of the skills and passion our 75,000 employees bring to
their jobs helping improve health care every day, and that many of them are
interested in sharing their informed perspectives constructively and
respectfully in the health reform debate," said UnitedHealth spokesman John
Parker.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is the latest in a series of attempts by major insurers to
enlist company employees as political advocates in the Washington debate
over health reform, and many Republicans argue that Democrats do the same
through e-mail and letter campaigns organized by trade unions. Consumer
Watchdog filed complaints earlier this year against UnitedHealth and
WellPoint Inc., another top insurance conglomerate, for allegedly pressuring
employees to lobby against health reform in violation of California
law.
</P>
<P>
At another major insurer, Indianapolis-based Cigna, two executives sent
a staff e-mail Wednesday criticizing the health reform package approved in
the House last weekend and urging Cigna employees "to act as emissaries for
our company and reach out to your elected officials to educate them." The
e-mail, which was also obtained by Consumer Watchdog, included a link to an
internal company Web site called "Talking Politics."
