With the momentum of remarkable growth in recent years, China's sports goods
industry giant LI- NING unveiled revitalization here on Wednesday by changing
its logo and slogan.
</P>
<P>
The LI-NING brand, founded in 1990 in the name of Chinese famous Gymnast Prince
Li Ning, has become an accomplished leader in sports brands in China with rapid
development. It ranked No. 2 nationwide in sports good selling in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Li, three-time Olympic champion in 1984, said:"I have a dream that to make the
real sport for real sport lovers. During my experience over the last 20 years, I
realized it is good to make a change."
</P>
<P>
Taking reference with its in-depth research into the maturity cycle of the
market, industry growth drivers, competition landscape analysis and positioning
and consumption trends, the brand adopted a re-invention approach.
</P>
<P>
The new logo seems displays a modern interpretation of the iconic attributes of
the original logo in a modern designed Chinese language. Not only has the new
logo narrated the rich visual heritage of the classic "LN" symbol, it has also
abstractly outlined the "Li Ning Cross"  gymnastic posture invented by Li Ning.
</P>
<P>
The new slogan  "Make The Change"  is adapted from a new brand manifesto that
speaks out the evolution from "dare to think" to "dare to do", encouraging
everybody to embrace changes and breakthroughs.
