Bora Milutinovic is getting yet another World Cup job, though he will not be coaching.

The well-traveled Serb has agreed to help his native country prepare for the 2010 tournament in South Africa by scouting other teams.

Tomislav Karadzic, the head of Serbia's Football Federation, said Milutinovic and his scouts "will help our coaching team get all the information (about opponents) and help our World Cup preparations."

Serbia was drawn in a World Cup group with Germany, Australia and Ghana.

The 64-year-old Milutinovic's last coaching job was leading Iraq at the Confederations Cup earlier this year. He also led Mexico (1986), Costa Rica (1990), the United States (1994), Nigeria (1998) and China (2002) at World Cups.
