<P>
Getting elected to the presidency is difficult; getting re-elected is harder;
getting re-elected when the economy is dragging is nearly impossible. In
American history, only one president has won a second term when the economy was
in dire shape: Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1936. This bleak record would seem to
bode ill for President Barack Obama as he looks toward 2012 across a clouded
economic horizon.
</P>
<P>
But Roosevelt's exception to the historical rule leaves some hope for Obama and
his supporters. Despite an unemployment rate above 15 percent - compared with
less than 10 percent today - Roosevelt won 61 percent of the popular vote and
swamped Republican Alf Landon, of Kansas, by the widest Electoral College margin
in American history: 523 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Of course, Roosevelt held some key cards, not all of which Obama enjoys. First,
his party commanded large majorities in both houses of Congress throughout his
first term: Democrats outnumbered Republicans more than two to one in the House
after the 1932 elections, and in the Senate by only a bit less. They increased
their majorities in both houses in the 1934 midterm contests. Not every Democrat
endorsed everything Roosevelt did; Southern conservatives, in particular,
disliked aspects of the New Deal. But when Roosevelt asked something of
Congress, he usually got it.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the record of accomplishment he took into the 1936 campaign was
breathtaking, if controversial. By then, the New Deal had restructured America's
banking industry, remodeled the farm sector, extended unemployment relief and
jobs programs, and woven a social safety net for ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
Obama's record is less impressive, largely because Democratic majorities have
been thinner, initially disposing the president to consider Republican
objections to such signature reforms as the health care overhaul and enabling
the GOP to stymie him on energy and the environment. Tuesday's elections, which
delivered the House to the Republicans, have made matters worse for Obama. For
the rest of his term, he will find himself in a far different position than the
first-term Roosevelt: He will be in opposition to Congress, rather than in
charge of it.
</P>
<P>
Second, Roosevelt's 1936 victory showcased a political style quite different
than Obama's; FDR had boxed with bare knuckles from the start of his first term.
Although his 1932 inaugural address is remembered today for its soothing
assurance that "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself," Roosevelt's
contemporaries focused on the bellicose tone of the rest of the speech, in which
the new president blamed Wall Street and its Republican sponsors for the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
"The rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their own
stubbornness and their own incompetence," Roosevelt said. ". . . Practices of
the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion,
rejected by the hearts and minds of men."
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt maintained the offensive throughout his first term, and in the
campaign of 1936 he hit harder than ever, blaming "economic royalists" who
wanted to restore the old regime of wealth and power. Their cronies had targeted
him for their special venom, Roosevelt said. "Never before in all our history
have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They
are unanimous in their hate for me." But he would stand fast. "And I welcome
their hatred."
</P>
<P>
Many of Obama's supporters wish he would emulate Roosevelt's combativeness. They
have lamented his efforts at bipartisanship, which yielded him little, they say,
and cost him the political momentum of 2008. But Obama has generally ignored
such counsel. Some of this difference owes to diverging temperaments and
personal styles; where Roosevelt relished getting angry in public, Obama
apparently does not. But it also reflects Obama's more precarious position with
respect to Congress. While Roosevelt's majorities were so strong that he could
afford to make enemies of his political opponents, if Obama had begun by
treating congressional Republicans as enemies, he probably would have gotten
even less in the way of reform than he did.
</P>
<P>
Yet political styles can change. With the Republicans soon to control the House,
and many of them outspoken in their determination to bring him down, Obama may
have no choice but to take off the gloves. (In this regard he might also borrow
from Roosevelt's successor, Harry Truman, who, after losing Congress to the
Republicans in 1946, railed against the "do nothing" legislature and eked out an
upset victory in 1948.) Obama proved a brilliant campaigner in 2008; he may show
the same talent, modified for new circumstances, in 2012.
</P>
<P>
Third, Roosevelt benefitted from an unexpectedly weak Republican candidate in
1936. Alf Landon was a son of the heartland and the only Republican governor to
survive the Democratic tidal wave of 1934. His friends called him "the Kansas
Coolidge," and with an entrepreneurial background and moderate views on social
issues, he seemed a credible challenger to Roosevelt and the New Deal. But
despite heavy funding from business and the support of the Republican press -
Chicago Tribune owner Robert McCormick ordered the paper's switchboard operators
to remind callers of the dwindling number of days left to save America from
Roosevelt's tyranny - Landon found himself unable to match Roosevelt's
experience, verve and charisma, and his campaign never got on track.
</P>
<P>
Obama's opponent in 2012 has yet to be chosen, of course, but the absence of a
Republican front-runner and the confusion caused by the rise of the tea party
movement create the possibility that the Republicans might wind up with a modern
Alf Landon. Obama can't count on it, but he certainly can hope.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Roosevelt had good timing. He entered the presidency a full three years
into the worst economic disaster the United States had ever faced, by which time
the system was so clearly broken that Americans gave him carte blanche.
Moreover, the Depression was deep enough when he took office that even by 1936,
voters still blamed Herbert Hoover and the Republicans. And crucially, the
economy had begun to recover by 1936, if slowly. The emergency measures of the
early New Deal had stabilized the financial system. Unemployment was still
historically high, but it had fallen by a third since 1932. Stock prices had
climbed dramatically. The economy wasn't nearly where it should have been, but
it was moving in the right direction, Roosevelt said repeatedly. And people
believed him.
</P>
<P>
Obama's timing has been less fortunate. He rode the financial crisis to victory,
but he inherited the recession that came with it. Because the recession deepened
after his election, he had much greater difficulty pinning the blame on his
predecessor than Roosevelt did. And while Obama succeeded in keeping the economy
from sliding into a depressive abyss, he got little credit, an injustice that
reveals a cruel fact of American politics: It is better to inherit a disaster
than to avert one.
</P>
<P>
Still, the economy has shown some positive signs during the past year, and if
the improvement accelerates into 2012, Obama will be able to make the case
Roosevelt made in 1936: We're not where we want to be, but we're getting there.
</P>
<P>
When Obama entered office, he was often likened to FDR. The parallels, and the
expectations they implied, were often exaggerated. There is a similar danger of
exaggerating the likelihood of a 1936-style win for Obama in 2012. For all sorts
of reasons, a victory of that magnitude isn't in the cards. But re-election just
might be.
