Billionaire Warren Buffett wants people to know he thinks the U.S. government performed well during the economic meltdown of 2008.

So the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. wrote a thank-you note to "Uncle Sam" that the New York Times published Wednesday on its op-ed page.

Buffett used the opinion piece to reiterate his view that the government should be praised for its efforts to stabilize the economy with massive bailouts and stimulus spending.
</P>
<P>
Buffett said in the article that specific decisions will be questioned, but Uncle Sam's actions during the crisis were "remarkably effective." He said that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke; Treasury secretaries Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner; FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair and former President George W. Bush all acted courageously to right the economy.
