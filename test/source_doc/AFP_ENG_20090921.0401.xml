Putin kept dying Yeltsin in 'golden cage': ex-PM

Russia's late president Boris Yeltsin believed in his last years his phones were
bugged and that he lived in a "golden cage" created by his successor Vladimir
Putin, a top Kremlin critic alleged Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ageing Yeltsin -- Russia's first democratically elected leader -- also had
his visitors restricted on Putin's orders, said Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime
minister who is now a bitter critic of the government.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov made the allegations in a book excerpt published in The New Times, an
opposition weekly. They were based on his conversations with Yeltsin in the
years before the ex-president's death in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stepped down as president in 2000 and was replaced by Putin, whose
presidency was marked by tighter state control on society and a worsening of
Russia's relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
According to Kasyanov, Yeltsin was bitter at Putin's policies and felt isolated
at his retirement residence outside Moscow, where he felt that his phone calls
were being monitored.
</P>
<P>
"They are listening to all my phones. It is hard to see how all this is
happening around us," Yeltsin told Kasyanov in one of their conversations,
according to the book excerpt.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also advised Kasyanov to buy a new mobile telephone each time he called
in order to avoid surveillance, Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov also said that Putin once told him to tell the rest of the Cabinet not
to visit Yeltsin because their visits were upsetting the ex-president and
worsening his health.
</P>
<P>
"This had the form of a friendly request, but in essence it was an order: nobody
is to go see Yeltsin anymore," Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Yeltsin was upset when Putin decided to mark his 75th birthday with
a formal event at the Kremlin, with an officially approved guest list, rather
than an informal party at home like Yeltsin wanted.
</P>
<P>
"I think it was then that he finally understood that he was living like a
prisoner in a golden cage," Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Putin dismissed the allegations from Kasyanov, who served as
prime minister from 2000 to 2004 when he was sacked by Putin, and later became a
fierce critic of his former boss.
</P>
<P>
"I do not regard the Kasyanov interview as something that needs to be commented
upon," Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Putin is now prime minister but is still widely seen as holding the true reins
of power in Russia.
