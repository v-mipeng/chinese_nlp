An alleged hostage situation near the state governor's mansion, reported Tuesday
by the lieutenant governor of the central US state of Missouri, was a false
alarm, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Police in Jefferson City were still evacuating the Governor Office Building,
which houses some state offices, as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
But Jefferson City police captain Mike Smith told reporters: "every indication
is that this was a false alarm."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said in a message on his Twitter
account that a hostage situation was going on.
</P>
<P>
Kinder said that "sharpshooters (are) on roof of Jefferson bldg. Hostage
situation unfolding" at the Governor Office Building across from the governor's
mansion in the state capital, Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
"Chopper overhead as hostage negotiators are on the scene," Kinder said on the
popular microblog. "Apparently it's unfolding on fifth floor Governor office
bldg."
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that traffic was blocked off across the
downtown area and at least one other building in the area was put under lockdown
as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
The fifth floor of the privately owned Governor Office Building is used by the
state Public Service Commission, which regulates investor-owned electric, steam,
natural gas, water and sewer and telephone companies, the newspaper said.
