ESPN's racial slur in Jeremy Lin story
</headline>

You have got to be fuccking kidding me with this.
<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/whether-intentional-not-espn-since-deleted-headline-jeremy-192208429.html">http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/whether-intentional-not-espn-since-deleted-headline-jeremy-192208429.html</a>
Whether intentional or not, ESPNâ€™s since-deleted headline about Jeremy Lin was distressing And Yahoo isn't letting me copy the text for some reason... basically some WTFucckery going on with a very evident racial slur being used in an ESPN headline.

Even using that phrase appropriately, I feel uncomfortable and weird, so I don't say it. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, there's a part where somebody watched somebody else through a "*** in the wall." I remember we were reading that out loud in high school and the person who was reading it stopped right before saying it and looked around at the teacher, like, "Am I supposed to go ahead and read this?" So basically, either that was intentional, or ESPN copy editors are less culturally sensitive than 14 year old kids.

There has been a good amount of this WTFuuuckery going on with the Jeremy Lin story. From the fortune cookie poster aired on TV to the headline that simply said "Amasian!"

I can't believe that it is 2012 and that people don't realize that this is inappropriate.

My students don't know the correct meaning so I always tell them before we read that part and have them say opening instead. I don't like to alter text but in that case I think it is appropriate.
In the Espn case it was said on air and then on their website. Just plain gross. People really miss the boat on cultural sensitivity.

But isn't the correct meaning a flaw/hole in English? I understand that in American English it is a racial slur but the original/ correct meaning was not a slur.
I also understand you telling them to use the word opening but I am just surprised you would refer to the slur as the correct meaning.

I don't tell them the slur is the correct meaning- they know the slur and NOT the correct meaning so I tell them the correct meaning. They don't want to say the slur and don't understand what the "*** in the wall" means. we avoid saying the "***" instead they say hole/opening in the wall.

I never said it was appropriate. I said I was surprised that she would tell them that correct meaning of *** is a slur.
The modern meaning is a slur but I would think that instead of framing it as the correct meaning and implying that in the play it was written as a slur one could explain that the correct meaning is a flaw/hole but in modern times it has been used as a slur and thus is not appropriate to use nowadays.

Really? They know it was not written with a slur in it. Why would a slur about Asians even fit in the context of Midsummers. They get that.They are taught what the correct definition.They pause because there only exposure has been the slur. It means opening and we move on.

I saw this yesterday and read the story - and then I had to think about where the racial slur was. I couldn't spot it at first because saying a "*** in his armour" is just a phrase I have read more than once - especially in the nerdy sci fi / fantasy books I read lol.
So while I can totally understand a person writing that as a headline by mistake (not sure what happened, but if that), it doesn't give this a pass because - correct me if I am wrong - there are people who check these things right? Its not just some dude who writes a thing and then out it goes...someone dropped the ball somewhere along the way.
But I dunno - I doubt it was deliberately racist. I mean, how long are you gonna last as a reporter in sports if you are racist lol? Sport is hardly the domain of the white fella. On the other hand it was very stupid. Very very stupid. Amazingly stupid in fact.

I assume it was deliberate because of when it was posted. 2:30am for 30 min, well after the game and while everyone's asleep. Seems like a silly, stupid joke that turns out wasn't a great idea... Unless Lin himself used his nature skillz and hacked it for the extra publicity (since they lost and all).

I thought this too. It has absolutely no racist connotations...also I guess I thought the phrase was still "modern."
The word has two meanings. If you are going around saying "A *** in his armor" and meaning it to be racist, I think that's kind of dumb.

but "to gyp" actually comes from stereotyping gypsies as swinders. "*** in the Amour" has nothing to do with the more modern term of calling someone of Chinese decent a "***" - if my googling isn't failing me.

The person who wrote the headline was fired, and the anchor was suspended for 30 days. Apparently the anchor was really just not thinking when he said it and didn't mean it as a slur - his wife is Asian. LOL that must have been a fun conversation about what an idiot he is when he got home.

I'm not sure I think it's a good idea to replace the word, when used in it's proper context, for students in an English class. I can't accurately express why, it just seems like it lends power to the offensive iteration of the term, rather than teach the real meaning. A pp brought up the term "spic and span." You wouldn't replace spic in that saying, if it were written in its correct context, would you?

IDK, he stated in a previous interview that in college, the would chant "***" at him, so my thought is that it may have bothered him a bit.
I also read yesterday that this is the SECOND time ESPN has used this headline - it was used in relation to the Men's B'ball team during the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

I'm certainly not trying to be contentious, but I believe I understood her correctly.
Jackpot:
"My students don't know the correct meaning so I always tell them before we read that part and have them say opening instead. I don't like to alter text but in that case I think it is appropriate."
She says here, specifically, that she replaces the word *** with the word opening, and that she alters the text.

Yes, she said this:
"I don't tell them the slur is the correct meaning- they know the slur and NOT the correct meaning so I tell them the correct meaning. They don't want to say the slur and don't understand what the "*** in the wall" means. we avoid saying the "***" instead they say hole/opening in the wall."
She is, in fact, replacing the word *** with the word opening in the text. That is what my original comment pertains to. I never thought she told them the definition was the slur, but I do disagree that the best response is to replace the term used in its correct context. I'm a teacher, too, and it's not the call I'd make.

I only knew the word as a noun (*** in the armor, *** in a wall) before I knew it as a racial slur.
Anyway, a friend of mine (who is South Asian, if it matters) said that he thinks that phrase would be commonly used in sports for a team that had been winning and then lost. "OH! Must be a *** in their armor somewhere." It said it's common, and it's an allusion to knights having a soft spot in their armor with which they could be defeated.
But since the world is a double entendre in this instance, and can also be used as a racial slur, it's not okay with me.

I agree with this. However, I'm not sure why this sort of thing results in an automatic firing. I would think a reprimand with a warning would be a good first step. If it happened again, then fire. Then again, maybe that's because my experience is with reprimanding students and most schools have different disciplinary measures that correspond to first, second, etc offenses.

Yeah no. Racist title = firing. And rightly so.

I'm an idiot. I thought the saying was "kink in the armour" and while I've read Midsummer's, I never noticed the word being in there. I've never heard the term "*** in the wall".
