我认为中国和美国双方的说法都有片面的地方！
我想知道其他国家的人关于这段历史的描述！
当然，如果你汉语好的话 可以把这段话翻译过去 谢谢！

I'm sure there's been discussions taken place other than in this thread, but I haven't been able to find them yet.

A tip: Try avoid using exclamation mark (感叹号) so frequently. They make your remarks sound either shallow and juvenile, or simply rude.

I would be very interested in reading about the Chinese side of the story. There's not too many Korean War era veterans left alive to tell the tale, but there's a decent short article on Wikipedia here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">Korean War - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>

You can also find articles here: <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/kowar/kowar.htm">Korean War</a> and here: <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/korean+war">Korean War &amp;mdash; Infoplease.com</a>

They're pretty generic though, and the writers tried to remain objective in their stories.

I thought you wanted the World Health Organization's version of the Korean War.
