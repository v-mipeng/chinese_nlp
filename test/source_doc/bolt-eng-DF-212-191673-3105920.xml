Not really, Taiwan is a part of China-so why wouldn't they defend their own.

There's a whole thread on this topic in the China Forum, with nifty pictures too. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/> )

From what I understand, the PLAN taskforce will be operated under Article 17 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which means they will have to come to aid of anyone under attack in that area, not just "Chinese" ships. They will be coordinated with the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet on where they are patrolling.

CDF is supposed to be more tightly moderated and has generally less trolls.

CDF seems more professional in its forums, Sinodefence though is a much sharper looking site and the information i has is generally quite current if a little on the conservative side. I find that between the two you will generally have all the information you need in regards to Chinese military affairs.

Facing land crunch, China exports farmers to Africa 30 Dec 2008, 0115 hrs IST, AGENCIES

Liu Jianjun is wearing a brightly coloured African tunic, the tall hat of a tribal leader, a string of red beads round his neck and carrying a stick
with a secret knife in the handle. Beside him sits a portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong. It is a slightly incongruous scene but one that mirrors the ever-closer relationship between Asias economic giant China and the worlds poorest continent.

The African people yell, Mao Zedong is all right and they are very warm-hearted when Im there, said one of Chinas most prominent private sector ambassadors. The minute Chinese people get off the plane, the Africans are friendly. Chinese do not bring rifles and weapons; they bring seeds and technology.

Chinas ministry of commerce announced this month that its bilateral trade with the continent is set to hit $100 billion by the end of 2008. Africas plentiful oilfields and rich mineral deposits are top of Chinas imports, and in return the worlds most populous nation is exporting tens of thousands of its countrymen, the Independent reported.

By some estimates, 750,000 Chinese people have spent time on the continent or have moved to Africa permanently to do business and take advantage of the natural resources. And Hebei, the province from where the middle-aged Liu hails, is no exception. He reckons 10,000 farmers from Hebei alone have gone to 18 African countries in the past few years.

They work in Baoding villages, named after the dusty township where Liu lives; he likes to point out that Baoding means Protection and peace. The villages, ranging in size from 400 to 2,000 Chinese, have been set up across the continent, from Nigeria to Kenya, from Sudan to Zambia.

It is a winning formula for China, which has more than 20% of the worlds population but only 7% of its arable land. China has too many people and too little land, Liu said. In Africa, they have plenty of land and too few farmers.

So, You Indian should cherish your cultivated land. or else, See us. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

Just a kidding. But I think the story you post has a few porblems. exporting farmers is not about land crunch, just about "gold rush", or take up an occupation in our words.
