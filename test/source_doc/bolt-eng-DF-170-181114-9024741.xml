The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at the University of California, San Diego, will provide expertise to a multi-year technology investment program to develop the next generation of extreme scale supercomputers. The project is part of the Ubiquitous High Performance Computing (UHPC) program, run by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), part of the U.S. Department of Defense. Intel Corporation leads one of the winning teams in the program, and is working closely with SDSC researchers on applications.
The first two phases of the project extend into 2014, and a full system design and simulation is expected at the completion of those phases in 2014. Phases 3 and 4 of the project, which have not yet been awarded, are expected to result in a full prototype system sometime in 2018.

You read what the Chinese are trying to do in the realms of engineering and education, it makes you weep.

US School math, computing, engineering and related schools are mostly turning out foreign students. US students can't be bothered. The halls and cafeteria of the school I go to are full of varios shades reading texts on calculus, trigonometry, electrical engineering etc. All the palefaces are playing farm ville or Mafia wars.

Actually, there are a lot of "if's" there.

First, their population is rapidly growing older due to their one child per family policy.

Second, the way their educational system is set up, it's very competitive. Slots are opened up and are available by intelligence and test scores. The most intelligent are NOT going into engineering, but into business.

I was reading in one of my engineering magazines about how an entire class of chemical engineers, after graduating, actually went into other fields because they didn't like the stink and dangers of chemical engineering in China. After all, they don't have the same safety standards that we do, in spite of Republicans working hard to deregulate.

The dangers are because Republicans in this country don't support education, and don't tell me they do. They don't.

Third, inventions and new technologies are moved to China because they have no safety regulations and their people, under a communist regime, work 60 to 70 hours a week for 51 cents an hour. Can anyone guess why the Republican leadership wants to get rid of the minimum wage?

If you want a good example of the Republican Party, read what right wingers on this thread say. They add nothing of any substance and have no clue. The reason they are able to make fun of those that have at least a small understanding of technology, is because they have none. I suspect several believe magic is involved in the way their computers work.

United States The World's Number One Innovator?
BY Saabira ChaudhuriWed Jan 7, 2009

The Global Innovation Index, a ranking of 130 countries released yesterday, calls the US the world's number one innovator. The index was created by Soumitra Dutta, a professor at French business school INSEAD, along with New Delhi based non-profit organization The Confederation of Indian Industry.

The global index ranks Germany second, Sweden third, the UK fourth and Singapore fifth. Contrary to what some might expect, China comes in relatively low at number 37, while India stands at number 41.

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3408/3177442804_fb2568f984.jpg"/>

The ranking is based on indices such as the number of internet users in a nation, the ease of doing business and the stability of banks (that score alone makes surprising that the U.S. tops the list). Every factor is then categorized as either an input or an output, with inputs indicating how conducive countries are to stimulating innovation (these include institutions and policies, human capacity, infrastructure, technological sophistication, business markets and capital). The outputs indicate how effectively countries translate innovation into benefits - like knowledge, competitiveness and wealth.

Everyone agrees that innovation is crucial for the US to dig itself out of the current economic hole. However, innovation is a largely subjective concept. And lately the US is coming under internal criticism for its lack of emphasis on innovation. Last year, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and former CTO of Cisco, Judy Estrin, stated that the US is suffering from "a national innovation deficit." And Vinton Cerf, the chief Internet evangelist at Google said, "There is a remarkable telescoping in of vision and an unwillingness to make long-term bets." In 2005, the National Academies published a report showing that the US government's financing of research in the physical sciences was 45 percent less in 2004 than in 1976.

Do rankings such as the Global Innovation Index influence corporate investment decisions? Not much, says Jacob Koshy of Livemint. In India for instance, over the last few years, several large multinationals have made significant investments in research centers

Yep as long as we keep Obama and the libs from handcuffing our business and innovators with all these stupid regulations and mandates and crap.

China's One Child Policy
One Child Policy in China Designed to Limit Population Growth

Jun 14 2010
China has proclaimed that it will continue its one child policy, which limits couples to having one child, through the 2006-2010 five year planning period.
China's one child policy was established by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979 to limit communist China's population growth. Although designated a "temporary measure," it continues a quarter-century after its establishment. The policy limits couples to one child. Fines, pressures to abort a pregnancy, and even forced sterilization accompanied second or subsequent pregnancies.

It is not an all-encompassing rule because it has always been restricted to ethnic Han Chinese living in urban areas. Citizens living in rural areas and minorities living in China are not subject to the law. However, the rule has been estimated to have reduced population growth in the country of 1.3 billion by as much as 300 million people over its first twenty years.

This rule has caused a disdain for female infants; abortion, neglect, abandonment, and even infanticide have been known to occur to female infants. The result of such Draconian family planning has resulted in the disparate ratio of 114 males for every 100 females among babies from birth through children four years of age. Normally, 105 males are naturally born for every 100 females.

Recent Effects of the One Child Law
Now that millions of sibling-less people in China are now young adults in or nearing their child-bearing years, a special provision allows millions of couples to have two children legally. If a couple is composed of two people without siblings, then they may have two children of their own, thus preventing too dramatic of a population decrease.
Although IUDs, sterilization, and abortion (legal in China) are China's most popular forms of birth control, over the past few years, China has provided more education and support for alternative birth control methods.

On Jan. 26, 1995, approximately 52 seconds into flight, a Chinese LM-2E carrying the Hughes APSTAR II communications satellite failed. This was the LM-2E's second failure. The first failure of the LM-2E in December 1992 involved an attempted launch of the Hughes OPTUS B-2 commercial communications satellite.

"Respondents decided to form and direct a launch failure investigation beginning in January 1995 and continuing throughout much of that year. The investigation involved the formation of several groups of leading technical experts from China and the U.S., which throughout the investigation engaged in an extensive exchange of technical data and analysis, producing a wide range of unauthorized technology transfers," noted the State Department charge document.

Clinton Overrules Secretary of State

The alleged improper export by Hughes of satellite technology was cited as a key reason when Clinton's secretary of state, Warren Christopher, rejected a plan to give the Commerce Department full authority to control satellite exports.

According to a Sept. 22, 1995, memorandum, Christopher rejected plans to give Commerce the authority to approve satellite exports after an interagency study noted that "significant" military and intelligence capabilities could be lost.

The memorandum stated the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies strongly opposed the policy change because Hughes exported two satellites with sensitive cryptographic technology without first getting a State Department munitions license. Cryptographic technology is used to scramble communications sent to satellites to prevent unauthorized access.

President Clinton, who transferred the power to regulate sensitive satellites to Commerce, under Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, ultimately overruled Christopher.

Clinton's transfer allowed the Chinese army to acquire advanced U.S. technology for military purposes. Hughes satellites currently provide the Chinese army with secure communications that are invulnerable to earth combat and highly accurate all-weather navigation for strike bombers and missiles.
Clinton Legacy – A New Arms Race

The satellite and missile technology obtained from Hughes by the Chinese army is critical for the design and manufacture of missile nose cones and electronic missile control systems. The technology clearly helped the Chinese army field a new generation of ICBMS, including the Dong Feng 31 missile, which can drop three nuclear warheads on any city in the U.S.

The success of Shen is a story of missiles, politics and greed. Gen. Shen succeeded in using Hughes and President Clinton as valuable tools to obtain weapons that are now pointed at the United States.

They have grants and projects that have been funded with 10 year windows....encompassing 3 main themes; energy (renewables, battey tech.), computing and nanotechnology.

FROM YOUR ARTICLE:

Chinese Army Gets U.S. Missile Technology for Money

A newly released document from the U.S. State Department reveals that the most successful Chinese espionage operation in recent history occurred during the Clinton administration.

The document accuses Hughes Space and Communications Company of violating U.S. national security 123 times by knowingly sending detailed missile and space technology directly to the Chinese army.

----------------------------------------

They don't need espionage now. Republicans have been moving that technology to China to make a buck. Was that the point to your article? I would think you would be embarrassed.

How many engineers in the US actually work in their field?

You are entirely correct, which is why Bush never raised the budget of the DOE by 70% between 2002 and 2004.

What does any of this have to do with them having more people? Are you saying the Chinese government is involved in a conspiracy to kill off its own population? If so, perhaps you should start a thread about it.

China's One Child Policy
One Child Policy in China Designed to Limit Population Growth

Jun 14 2010
China has proclaimed that it will continue its one child policy, which limits couples to having one child, through the 2006-2010 five year planning period.
China's one child policy was established by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979 to limit communist China's population growth. Although designated a "temporary measure," it continues a quarter-century after its establishment. The policy limits couples to one child. Fines, pressures to abort a pregnancy, and even forced sterilization accompanied second or subsequent pregnancies.

It is not an all-encompassing rule because it has always been restricted to ethnic Han Chinese living in urban areas. Citizens living in rural areas and minorities living in China are not subject to the law. However, the rule has been estimated to have reduced population growth in the country of 1.3 billion by as much as 300 million people over its first twenty years.

This rule has caused a disdain for female infants; abortion, neglect, abandonment, and even infanticide have been known to occur to female infants. The result of such Draconian family planning has resulted in the disparate ratio of 114 males for every 100 females among babies from birth through children four years of age. Normally, 105 males are naturally born for every 100 females.

Recent Effects of the One Child Law
Now that millions of sibling-less people in China are now young adults in or nearing their child-bearing years, a special provision allows millions of couples to have two children legally. If a couple is composed of two people without siblings, then they may have two children of their own, thus preventing too dramatic of a population decrease.
Although IUDs, sterilization, and abortion (legal in China) are China's most popular forms of birth control, over the past few years, China has provided more education and support for alternative birth control methods.

China won and the U.S. lost what may very well be the first round of World War III. Gen. Shen led that victory and he did it with a checkbook. The Clinton legacy for the 21st century is a new arms race.

these people should have been prosecuted not helped. This tech transfer was illeagal no matter who does it. Just pointed out you're boy Clinton would do anything for a contribution and also that you're an idiot and don't know what you're talking about, nothing new with you libs

Given the population and amount of arable land in China, that is exactly what a responsible government of any kind would do in that situation. Any sudden change in rainfall patterns or temperatures, such as we experianced after Tambora, 1815, or Krakatoa, 1883, blew up, will cause the deaths from starvation of a substancial percentage of the population.

I really find it difficult to understand why Conservatives prefer the deaths of millions of people, rather than a responsible approach to population.

Maybe they just believe in Darwin and the survival of the fittest. Or maybe, just maybe, it is because they are actually smarter than you.

They adapted that policy in the late 70s because all the smart scientists who were not talking about your history revision global warming were talking about the fact that the Earth would not be able to support a population of 5 billion human beings. That means that the policy was, and still is, based on faulty science, and not on need.

That is the real reason conservatives oppose government intervention in the right of people to make their own decisions.

Are they? Or is it market forces that the government follows behind?

What you seem to forget is that the government does not lead, it follows. If the people wanted their country to look like that, it would. The difference between China and here is that the government is in charge there, and doesn't care about the people. Nothing unusual there, governments never care about people, all they care about is power.

Of course you are not. And when the inevitable happens, then you will blame someone else for not having a plan for it. China has gone through many cycles of starvation in the past where litterally millions starved to death. But the idea of reducing the population to the point that China can weather a drouth without mass starvation by a one child policy is something you find offensive. More offensive than the idea of millions starving to death. I find Conservative morality to be offensive.

Nor has the population bomb been discredited. A wonderful man by the name of Borlaug pushed the limit back a bit. But all it would take is a couple more crop failures like the ones in Pakistan and Russia this year to show the validity of the concept. Or, conversely, one eruption the equal of Tambora.

I would challenge you to show anywhere where I blame anyone for not having a plan. I actually have volunteered for NGOs that send people in to help, and they rarely have a plan in place before a disaster strikes, because it is more efficient to react to the problem than attempt to plan out all the potential scenarios and make contingencies for all of them. It takes a huge staff, and a lot of money, to plan for everything, and it is almost always a waste of bit the staff, and the time involved.

As for the population bomb, wasn't that supposed to go off when we exceeded the ability of the worlds farmers to support a population above 4 billion? Or should we just look at the fact that India was going to implode by 1971 because there was no way the limited arable land would support a population of 600,000,000. Yet they support twice that now, and are not facing imminent starvation.

Wasn't technology supposed to make things worse? I seem the recall another assertion that technological societies had less of a chance of dealing with the dangers than low tech societies. Funny how inaccurate that turned out to be, isn't it? Most of the world is where we were in the late 60s and early 70s, and we are still around.

The fact that you are trying to claim it is not entirely discredited, despite the fact that we have far surpassed the point of no return, shows how much you should be taken seriously. "Wonderful" men can push the numbers back as far as they want, what really makes the difference is the ability of people to overcome problems. We might someday face a problem we cannot solve, but it will not be overpopulation, or global cooling, that other great scientific farce from that time.

Yep I remember reading about this when I was a kid <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

Today it's global warming; in the '70s it was the coming ice age

Many Seattleites pride themselves on a fanatical environmentalism that frankly defies reason. On Earth Day, we commonly hear dark predictions about the looming horrors of global warming (a typical example, What is at stake [is] our ability to live on planet Earth, Al Gore).

Yet not so long ago the news media issued dire warnings about global cooling and a coming Ice Age. Consider these headlines:

The Earths Cooling Climate, Science News, November 15, 1969.

Colder Winters Held Dawn of New Ice Age, Washington Post, January 11, 1970.

Science: Another Ice Age? Time Magazine, June 24, 1974.

The Ice Age Cometh! Science News, March 1, 1975.

The Cooling World, Newsweek, April 28, 1975.

Scientists Ask Why World Climate is Changing; Major Cooling May Be Ahead, New York Times, May 21, 1975.

In the Grip of a New Ice Age? International Wildlife July-August, 1975.

A Major Cooling Widely Considered to Be Inevitable, New York Times, September 14, 1975.

Variations in the Earths Orbit, Pacemaker of the Ice Ages, Science magazine, December 10, 1976.
Reporters told the public about global cooling in the same confident tone used in todays coverage about global warming, creating the strong impression that no reasonable person could disagree
