Where should you live? POLL

I just took an online quiz to find out where fits me best as far as where I should live, to see how close it is to the place I've chosen. The top 4 locations are within a few hours of my chosen city, so I'm pretty confident that I'm making a good choice for when I move at the end of the year.
Where does it say you should live, and is it accurate for where you'd like to be?

Why is it like a maze to get to my results?

Ok, this is weird. I got Tacoma, WA as my first
Bloomington, IN as my second
Hendersonville, NC, 3rd

I looked at the first page and know i live in the wrong place. San Antonio is not a place for someone who hates heat and likes rain.

Ditto. Too bad, I was really curious about my results! You should have mentioned you have to make an account to get the results, would have saved me 5 mins.

I knew I grew up in the wrong area. I've lived in NJ all my life, but 5 out of my top 6 spots are in Arkansas.

That domain name suggests the website is about a verrrry different topic. <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink"/>

I did this a few years ago and ended up moving to one of my top spots for grad school.I used the info to help me narrow down locations before applying.
It was pretty accurate.

Ditto this. Though I'm pretty certain it was going to tell me I should live exactly where I already do live.

My top answers were all VA &amp; NC....which would be great places for us to go except we are likely going to move a little bit closer to my family.

<a href="http://www.findyourspot.com/city-detail/530/NatchitochesLA">Natchitoches, Louisiana</a> Which would be great. I would be fairly close to my sister.

evidently I should live in oregon - doesn't matter where, just oregon. which is good because it's the only place other than CO I would move without a reason (like job or family or whatever).

My top three results are:
Honolulu
Las Vegas
Little Rock
I wouldn't mind Honolulu, I don't think. The other two are not options. My city is on the list, but it's not until the third page.

I specified the Northeast but my top couple of spots were all in CA - good thing DH wants to retire there, I guess.
A couple places in VT are in my top 5, as is Northampton, MA - which is a good 20 minutes from where I was born and about 30 minutes from where I grew up. Although I ran out of town at my first chance, Northampton IS a great town.
Kind of interesting.

Waste of time but it did tell me that my number one spot was Baltimore, MD and my eighth spot was the city I actually DO live in. So I guess I am where I'm supposed to be.
And then a few places in Connecticut, Hawaii, WV, Mass. and Rhode Island in between.

<post author="IheartCosm..." datetime="2012-01-09T16:19:00" id="p19">
I totally called it.
#1 San Diego.
The rest of the top 6 are all in CA and #6 is Honolulu.
and not a single town in all 4 pages is in NJ. I did get Province, RI, Boston, and Washington DC though, which are more realistic than CA.
Gah, I want to move to California so badly.

My top 3: San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland.
Makes sense. Like Seattle but with sun.

It didn't mention anywhere in NJ- but mentioned lots of places in and around NYC - so i guess it got it right in a lot of ways.... it also said Tampa- where i have actually lived and liked a lot.

<post author="cjeanette" datetime="2012-01-09T17:10:00" id="p24">
Hartford, CT
Milwaukee, WI
Worchester, MA

Most of the options it gave me were in CT or WI. I suppose both meet my criteria of all 4 seasons and not a plan tree in sight.

I used this site once about a year ago and it didn't make you go through all these hoops!
I got Norfolk, VA as my top spot. I'm not surprised.

Well it said my first choice was Portland, OR.
But then, creepily enough, my second and third choices were Boston, MA and Providence, RI, respectively.
Anyone else get where they actually live on their list?

<post author="amamba" datetime="2012-01-09T18:07:00" id="p28">
Oh, and the rest of the first page was filled out with Hartford, CT, New Haven, CT and Baltimore, MD.
I think it is random to have Hartford and places like Worcester, MA on the list. I don't think anyone actually wants to live in Worcester.
