Children may face a high risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or
ADHD, if they are exposed to tobacco smoke before being born or to lead during
their childhood, a new study shows.
</P>
<P>
In the study, researchers from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
evaluated 2001 - 2004 data from the National Center for Health Statistics at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention among kids ranging from 8 to 15 years
old.
</P>
<P>
The research team measured prenatal tobacco exposure by maternal reports of
cigarette use during pregnancy, while lead exposure was assessed by the
participants' current blood lead levels.
</P>
<P>
Based on the data, which is part of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, children exposed to tobacco smoke prenatally were found 2.4
times more likely to suffer ADHD.
</P>
<P>
Those with blood lead levels in the top third had a 2.3-times increase, despite
the levels being well below the action level of 10 micrograms per deciliter
prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco and lead exposure each have their own adverse effects," said Tanya
Froehlich, M.D., one of the study's leading researchers in the Division of
Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's. "But if
children are exposed to both lead and prenatal tobacco inhalation, the combined
effect is synergistic."
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, for children exposed to both tobacco and lead, the
risk of ADHD will be enhanced by over eight times as much as the unexposed ones.
</P>
<P>
The new study, which was for release online on Nov. 23 by Pediatrics magazine,
also estimates that up to 35 percent of ADHD cases in children between the ages
of 8 and 15 could be reduced by eliminating both of these environmental
toxicants exposures. This could translate into up to 800,000 children in the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Our study suggests that reducing exposures to environmental toxicants might be
an important way to lower rates of having ADHD," said Robert Kahn, the study's
senior author.
</P>
<P>
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is one of the most common mental
disorders that develop in children. Children with ADHD have impaired functioning
in multiple settings, including home, school, and in relationshiops with peers.
