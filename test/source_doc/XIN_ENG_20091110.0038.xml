The following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers on Wednesday.
The Australian:
-- Minimum literacy and numeracy standards in schools are set too
low, and are substantially below the level of skills deemed
necessary to enter the workforce. The Council of Australian
Governments Reform Council says while 90 percent of students
nationally meet minimum standards set for schools, about half of
all people of working age fail to meet the level governments
consider necessary in the workforce.
The Sydney Morning Herald:
-- Police are investigating if the gruesome murder of the Lin
family in March was a case of mistaken identity relating to a
convicted people smuggler called "David" Min Lin. David Min Lin,
a computer student from Ryde who was born in the Chinese city of
Fuqing, was involved in a failed attempt 10 years ago to smuggle
69 Chinese immigrants by boat to Australia.
The Canberra Times:
-- Austraian Capital Territory's principals have warned a new
website that provides information on schools around the country
could lead to the creation of league tables. Education Minister
Julia Gillard previewed the myschool.edu.au at a meeting of 150
school principals from around Australia Tuesday. And she insisted
"there is no part of this website that can be sorted into a
league table by using sort functions on the computer."
