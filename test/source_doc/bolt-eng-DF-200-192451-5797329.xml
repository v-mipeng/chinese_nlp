I Think the question says it all! Where is Earth's Best City! Submit any city you think qualifies as the best and at the end we will decide if you could visit one city before you die which would be it. Well the name you submit can be in different categories like Architecture, Modernism, Conservationism, Fashion, Style, and more! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> <img src="images/smilies/colone.gif"/> and yup reply only if you are serious :P

Hmmm interesting question. Obviously I'm only able to pick from cities I've been to, Barcelona was fantastic for culture and architecture and I guess a lot of people are going to say New York which is great but I thought Boston was better.

In short my vote would probably go to Barcelona.

of the ones i have been to, Barcelona

london's good in terms of infrastructure and economy and education, yes. But you need more than that to be a great city. Spend a week in Barca and then a week in London, see which is better for quality of life. I know where i'd rather live personally.

Not true. New York has things for everyone.

It is by far the best city in the world. All the hype is not just there for no reason.

There are so many I can think of but I don't know if anyone would agree. I like London, Paris and Boulder, CO. I'm not sure if it's a town or a city but it's lovely (and full of hipsters. We actually saw one guy sat in the street with a typewriter.)

Berlin, spent 4 months in my German teacher's flat (she wasn't there obv) and doing bar work, had a ****ing blast. The nightlife was great and the people were friendly and patient.

NYC, similar to the above I was doing menial work to support myself but still had a ball, the music scene is thriving and there are so many things to do, the conversationism isn't as good as LDN but the parks are still pretty nice.

Going to a city for a week or two isn't enough time to gauge how good it is, you have to scrape by, struggle to support yourself and search out people and entertainment in order to gain a complete experience. I had no choice because I'm from a working class background but if any of you middle class (or higher) people choose to go to another city then I implore you to spend time supporting yourself, it's fulfilling as hell.

Sydney, I have seen quite a few of the 'big' cities (New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Tokyo, London, Dubai..) and I have to say it was the most friendly, beautiful and clean of them all also seemed to be least congested and close to lovely beaches. That said there are a lot of smaller, yet great cities but I'll keep this to the big ones that everyone knows. I really like some Scandinavia's cities but they don't really register on the world map

edit- my top 5

1. Sydney
2. San Francisco
3. New York
4. London
5. Paris

New York City by a long way. It's so much better than London it's amazing. About the only thing London has over NYC is History. Las Vegas is also amazing to visit but it's not somewhere you'd want to live.

- Largest performing arts festival in the world, largest book festival in the world, largest comedy festival in the UK, and about 12 other festivals including a Film Festival where Toy Story 3 had it's world premier (ie. outside of USA).
- Highest density of listed buildings in the UK.
- Second highest GDP per capita in the UK (after London).
- Highest percentage of pupils attending Private Schools in the UK (and that is from someone who didn't go private, in Edinburgh private schools are better in at least the academic sense)

I agree with almost everything you said here ( I love The Burgh!)

But seriously how does the private school thing make it a good city? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>
I personally feel that it's one of the city's bad points. Since a disproportionate amount of children (1 in 4) go to private schools in Edinburgh I think this leads to the state schools doing less well. It also means there's a lot of holier than thou private school attitude in Edinburgh.

Disclaimer: I know a lot of privately educated people AREN'T remotely snobby, but as a generalisation...

Talking as someone who has been to Sydeny, London, New York, LA, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai all in the last 5 years i would say Shanghai if you like modern architecture and helpful people but if you like seeing sites and shoping New York is a defo. My 'BEST CITY' however is Seoul but that could be due to me going with friends not family (and being able to drink, unlike in the USA)

I don't think it MAKES it a good city, its more of an indicator of one. Private schools are businesses which are dependant on customers, ie. rich folk. If a city has a large enough percentage of rich folk to support so many private schools then that surely is an indicator of prosperity? <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

i think the question says it all! where is earth's best city! submit any city you think qualifies as the best and at the end we will decide if you could visit one city before you die which would be it. Well the name you submit can be in different categories like architecture, modernism, conservationism, fashion, style, and more! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> :e and yup reply only if you are serious <img src="images/smilies/tongue.png"/>

Well, I suppose it depends on what you're looking for. Personally, I prefer London to New York, but I also love Berlin. Each to their own.

True; my nomination was probably motivated more by the somewhat frivolous overtones of others' contributions than by any meaningful assessment of social infrastructure, economic prosperity or general habitability. But who wants to see photographs of Seattle?

In the UK; I like Edinburgh and Bristol, London is a world city but I'm not convinced it is very liveable. Outside of the UK - I love Berlin (which is hugely underrated), it has a great cultural scence, is reasonably priced, it oozes history and you will have trouble getting bored. Loads of the Scandanavian cities are liveable - but they fall short on how interesting they are to live in. In terms of being seats of power/finance - NYC, Paris, Tokyo, London, Hong Kong (and increasingly Shanghai and Beijing).

The Space Needle is quite aesthetically pleasing. Although when vis-a-vis with Venice it will fall short, granted.

Why Hangzhou in particular? Big city, but in Chinese terms just a commuter town for Shanghai... probably less smoggy though I'd imagine.

Going on the Flam railway next year so I will compare Bergen to Oslo, dont think it will beat it though. I rate Oslo higher than New York, London and Rome its such a fantastic city.

The nicest I have been to are either Barcelona or Budapast. However, Barcelona trumps on the fact is has a beach, and every time you come out of a tube station there's a skate spot!

Zurich is really nice too when the weather is good; it has such fantastic countryside in the surrounding areas.

I was there in June and just found it to be sort of perfect version of the UK, clean streets (I dont remember ever seeing litter), everyone I met was very polite, warm, helpful and welcoming, public transport was amazingly well run. Lots of culture Ibsen museum and Norsk folk museum where highlights for me, beautiful parks, lovely harbour the view from frognerseteren. Every single woman was really attractive when is obviously a bonus.
The fact you can stand right outside parliament and the palace was jaw dropping when you comparing Oslo to New York and London most public buildings are like fortresses.
I'm slightly biased my girlfriend is half icelandic half norwegian so I was staying with her mothers family in Frogner so having all those people around probably swayed it for me.
Karl Johans gate is the best street in the world, I could sit drinking coffee outside the grand cafe for the rest of my life.

The whole city is just perfect in my eyes <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

It doesn't have the same wonderful reputation in Norway, but it's nice that you think that. I thought Oslo was OK, and I really like Karl Johan but I prefer Bergen (which is a beautiful city). I'm from the west coast though, and probably a little biased. Bergen is the unofficial capital of Western Norway after all. Yes, I've heard about the whole royal palace thing. I didn't know it was a little "weird" before people from other countries started commenting on it. Let's hope that Norwegian society will continue to be open and free.

This part makes me sad I was there just before the terrorism, I'm going back next year for the May 17th celebration so I hope it hasnt changed too much. There dosnt need to be all kinds of wonderous sights to make a city "the best" Oslo has some amazing ones but combining then with the open and free society makes is what makes it the best city for me.

It is sad. It was such a huge shock and 22 July feels like a distant nightmare.. Oh you're going back for 17th May? Lovely! I'm a big fan of 17th May and I love wearing my bunad. I'm going to miss walking in the children's parade, I think!
