An intern selected from among more than a million candidates in China, 24-year-
old Luo Xingcheng, said Monday that he considers himself lucky to have had the
chance to observe cross-Taiwan Strait differences for two months.
</P>
<P>
He was among a group of interns sponsored in 2009 by the Mainland Affairs
Council, which provided each of them with a round-trip flight ticket, a monthly
allowance of NT$20,000 (US$620) and a materials subsidy of NT$20,000.

<P>
Luo, a graduate student from Nankai University in northern China's Tianjin
Province, said he came to experience Taiwan and found that the differences
between  Taiwan  and China are obvious, particularly in education and the
media's work environment.
</P>
<P>
"The impact on me was huge, " Luo said, adding that "Taiwan's media developed
earlier so it has become more mature and is more objective in handling news
issues."
</P>
<P>
Luo and seven other interns were received as the first group of interns for 2009
by Chinese Culture University College of Journalism and Communication. They were
scheduled to return to China Wednesday following their stay, which included a
two-week trip around Taiwan, a month-long internship in media organizations, and
two weeks for essay-writing. The next group of eight interns were scheduled to
arrive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hsia Shi-fen, a staff member from Chinese Culture University, said the interns
got a very good impression of Taiwan and the Taiwanese people, and also
experienced the country's open media environment during their stay.
</P>
<P>
After two months in the company of the Chinese interns, Hsia went on, some of
the local students have also altered their impressions about Chinese students.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwanese students thought the Chinese visitors would not be well off, but
in fact they were quite willing to spend money, "Hsia added.
