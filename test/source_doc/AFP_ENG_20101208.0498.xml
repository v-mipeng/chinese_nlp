A museum in Taiwan has removed the late Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Mao
Zedong from an online poll of influential historical figures after their
inclusion sparked controversy on the island.
</P>
<P>
Deng had ranked number one in the military category in a poll of the 100 most
important people in modern Chinese and Taiwanese history conducted by the state-
run history archive museum Academia Historica.
</P>
<P>
Mao was number three in the running for top political leader, ahead of his
Kuomintang (KMT) party arch-rival Chiang Kai-shek, according to Taiwanese media.
</P>
<P>
Both Deng and Mao spent years fighting the KMT on the mainland, in one of the
bloodiest civil wars in history, eventually forcing the party to evacuate to
Taiwan in 1949.
</P>
<P>
A museum official told AFP that Deng and Mao were removed from the poll on
Wednesday after it was deemed "inappropriate" to have them listed.
</P>
<P>
The move came immediately after Vice Defence Minister Chaou Shih-chang expressed
concerns in parliament that it was "improper" to include Deng in the poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll is part of a series of activities celebrating next year's 100th
anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, Taiwan's formal title.
</P>
<P>
Although China and Taiwan have been ruled separately for 61 years, Beijing still
sees the island as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if
necessary.
