Sickle-cell a "beneficial mutation"??

<post author="gungasnake" datetime="2006-02-18T01:18:00" id="p1">
I'm always sort of amazed at the contortions you have to go through to even comprehend what evolosers are talking about sufficiently to argue with them.

Take "beneficial mutations" for instance. Aside from the fact that they don't really exist, the most common example of such a thing which you hear from the e-losers is sickle-cell anemia, which is supposed to confer some limited immunity from malaria.

Think about that for a minute. I mean, if I'm the chief of some African village, the only thing I could think of worse than having half the village dying of malaria, would be having half the village dying of malaria and the other half dying of sickle-cell anemia.

I mean, I could as easily walk up to one of those villagers and shoot him through the head with my 45, and that would prevent him from dying of malaria as well...

I mean, can you picture Teddy Roosevent or somebody like that out on some African safari, and some African girl runs up yelling

HEEEEEELP!!!! SAVE ME, Bwana, I's in danger of dying of MALARIA!!!! I needs you to shoot me through my head with that 375 H&amp;H you's carryin, so that old malaria bug don't GET me!!!

The allele benefits its heterozygous carriers, hence it survives -- at a low frequency. If 4% of the alleles are for sickle-cell, only 0.16% of the population gets sickle-cell.

It's an example that the basic biology textbook people have latched onto as a handy illustration of "hybrid vigor" (a term I am using somewhat inappropriately, but it's close enough for the present circumstances).

Love ya, snake.

Hi.

The sickle cell mutation was great until the Africans were dragged to another environment. It didn't become bad until they stopped getting bitten by so many skeeters. Then their genetic overcompensation, previously a lifesaver, screwed them up.

The same thing happened with Europeans (though they chose to leave, instead of being dragged), which resulted in cystic fibrosis, when they were no longer freezing their collective balls off, requiring lung-y lubrication.

INNERESTING EH!!??

Based on the potential problems of sickle cell, if we presume sickle cell was an adaptive process? I fail to see the connection.

You may be right, there might possibly be a more depressing state than that one. And there is natural beauty during the 4 months that the sun shows its face. Yes, I'm exaggerating. Unfortunately, said natural beauty can't make up for the rest of it.

Simple enough. The actual evidence we have indicates the following:

That somewhere in recent prehistoric times, the engineering and re-engineering of complex life forms was some sort of an industry or ongoing process on this planet, and that more than one pair of hands was involved. There is, for example, no rational way to picture a loving and omnipotent God creating biting flies, mosquitos, chiggers, ticks, or disease vectors and organisms. Whoever created those things was some sort of an a$$hole.

And that all such activity stopped somewhere prior to the dawn of recorded history, and that no such processes are currently in motion. The only change in living forms which is taking place at present is due to microevolution which nobody questions, and the experimentation of man.

Yes. I won't muck up gunga's thread anymore, but they only have one really fine antebellum estate, which has been converted into a really elegant inn--The Greyfield--and an old church--where JFK, Jr was married--no phones on the island. It is probably as close as one can find in such pritine shape. You have to ferry over there.

There are about five or so other barrier islands. I'll start that Georgia thread.

What Hitler saw in Darwinism
Evolution is junk science and, as junk science goes, it's dangerous junk science. It was the basic philosophical cornerstone of naziism, communism, the eugenics movements of the previous two centuries, and all manner of other grief.

To even comprehend evolutionite BS sufficiently to argue against them, you have to allow your mind to wander into a sort of a fairytale realm, in which such things as beneficial mutations actually exist. That ideology also demands that substituting gentic change through any sort of a large herd of animals HAS to cause the animals with the old genetic basis to die out, since otherwise, we would see individuals at every step of an evolutionary process actually walking around, and we don't. In theory that is, the so-called "selective advantage" of the new genetic mutation has to slowly kill off the old stock, and it's hard to say whether they're supposed to all die of jealousy or what the hell exactly.

In real life, when some slight (microevolutionary) change in a human population takes place, our present racial divisions for instance, then people of all types simply keep on walking around and going about their business. Moreover, in real life, the normal English term for "mutation" is "birth defect". I mean, I've never yet had the women from the Mothers' March of Dimes come to my door asking for donations for research to CAUSE mutations.....

The hell of it is, reading through this stuff, I've gotten a glimpse of what Hitler and some of the other 20'th century leaders were looking at, assuming you take that sort of BS seriously that is, and the nazis did. If old racial stocks are supposed to die out when new and better stock comes on the scene, then you're not doing members of the old stock any favors by prolonging the agony. Kind of like the thing General LeMay said about the firebomb raids over Japan when he noted you weren't doing a dog with a cancerous tail any favors by cutting the tail off in slices.

In other words, neither Stalin nor Hitler were guilty of any failure of logic; the only thing in which they erred was in buying off on Chuck Darwin's BS and Chuck, in my estimation, is a legitimate candidate for stupidest white man ever to walk the Earth.

Creationists, Hitler and Evolution

by Lenny Flank

(c) 1999

A common charge made by creationists is that evolutionary theory is "evil" and is the source of racism in general, and of dictatorial killers in particular. The most often-heard assertion is that Hitler and his racist genocide were the product of "evolutionary philosophy". Henry Morris, for instance, flatly declares, "However one may react morally against Hitler, he was certainly a consistent evolutionst." (Morris, "Evolution and Modern racism", ICR Impact, October 1973) Morris adds: "The philosophies of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche--the forerunners of Stalin and Hitler--have been particularly baleful in their effect: both were dedicated evolutionists." (Morris, Troubled Waters of Evolution, 1974 p. 33)

How accurate is this creationist finger-pointing? Not very. The creationists are apparently unaware of the fact that Stalinist Russia rejected Darwinian evolution as "bourgeois" and instead embraced the non-Darwinian "proletarian biology" of Lysenko and Michurin (a disaster from which Russian genetics and biological sciences has still not completely recovered). As for Hitler, even a cursory reading of his book Mein Kampf reveals that the true source of Hitler's inspiration and exhortations came from a source that creationists, understandably, would rather not talk about.

Hitler's goal was the "purification" of the "Aryan race" through the elimination of "subhumans", which included Jews, gypsies, Asians, black Africans, and everyone else who was not a white Aryan. Despite the creationists claims that this was based on Darwinain evolutionary theory, Hitler's own writings give quite a different story. The ICR claims that "Hitler used the German word for evolution (Entwicklung) over and over again in his book." (ICR Impact, "The Ascent of Racism", Paul Humber Feb 1987) Like so many of ICR's claims, this one is simply not true---a quick scan of several online English translations of Mein Kampf shows only ONE use of the word "evolution", in a context which does not refer at all to biological evolution, but instead to the development of political ideas in Germany: "This evolution has not yet taken the shape of a conscious intention and movement to restore the political power and independence of our nation."

Had ICR made even a cursory reading of Mein Kampf, they would have seen a quite different source for Hitler's racist inspiration than the one they would have us believe. White Aryans, Hitler writes, are the special creations of God, the "highest image of the Lord", put here specifically to rule over the "subhuman" races: "Human culture and civilization on this continent are inseparably bound up with the presence of the Aryan. If he dies out or declines, the dark veils of an age without culture will again descend on this globe. The undermining of the existence of human culture by the destruction of its bearer seems in the eyes of a folkish philosophy the most execrable crime. Anyone who dares to lay hands on the highest image of the Lord commits sacrilege against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and contributes to the expulsion from paradise." (all quotes from Hitler, Mein Kampf, online version) Actions which aid the "subhumans" at the expense of the Aryan master race, Hitler declared, were an offense against God: " It is a sin against the will of the Eternal Creator if His most gifted beings by the hundreds and hundreds of thousands are allowed to degenerate in the present proletarian morass, while Hottentots and Zulu Kaffirs are trained for intellectual professions."

Rather than basing his racism on any evolutionary theory, Hitler based it squarely on his view of white Aryans as the favored people of God. In fact, Hitler solemnly declares that his program of removing Jews and other "subhumans" from the earth is a divine task forced upon him by the Lord Almighty: "What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and reproductionof our race and our people, the sustenance of our children and the purityof our blood, the freedom and independence of the fatherland, so that ourpeople may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted it by the Creator of the universe."

Hitler concludes: "Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord," adding "Compared to the absurd catchword about safeguarding law and order, thus laying a peaceable groundwork for mutual swindles, the task of preserving and advancing the highest humanity, given to this earth by the benevolence of the Almighty, seems a truly high mission." For Hitler, removing the subhumans from earth was not a matter of biology or evolution---it was a divine mandate from God Himself, the "work of the Lord", a "truly high mission".

Even in discussing racial purity and "race-mixing", Hitler chooses not the words of evolutionary biology or eugenics, but points instead to his divinely holy mission: "Historical experience offers countless proofs of this. It shows with terrifying clarity that in every mingling of Aryan blood with that of lower peoples the result was the end of the cultured people. North America, whose population consists in by far the largest part of Germanic elements who mixed but little with the lower colored peoples, shows a different humanity and culture from Central and South America, where the predominantly Latin immigrants often mixed with the aborigines on a large scale. By this one example, we can clearly and distinctly recognize the effect of racial mixture. The Germanic inhabitant of the American continent, who has remained racially pure and unmixed, rose to be master of the continent; he will remain the master as long as he does not fall a victim to defilement of the blood. The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following: To bring about such a development is, then, nothing else but to sin against the will of the Eternal Creator."

The goal of the "folkish government", then, Hitler declares is to "finally to put an end to the constant and continuous original sin of racial poisoning, and to give the Almighty Creator beings such as He Himself created."

"The folkish-minded man, in particular," Hitler concludes, "has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of God's will, and actually fulfill God's will, and not let God's word be desecrated. For God's will gave men their form, their essence and their abilities. Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation, the divine will."

In Mein Kampf, Hitler makes an emotional appeal to God to aid him and his Nazis in their divine task: "Then, from the child's story-book to the last newspaper in the country, and every theatre and cinema, every pillar where placards are posted and every free space on the hoardings should be utilized in the service of this one great mission, until the faint-hearted cry, "Lord, deliver us," which our patriotic associations send up to Heaven to-day would be transformed into an ardent prayer: 'Almighty God, bless our arms when the hour comes. ' " Later, when Nazi troops swarmed over Europe, each of them wore an army-issue belt buckle inscribed with the words "God is With Us".

The invocation of God and the Bible in support of racism continues with modern hate groups in the US. Aryan Nations, which also calls itself the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, begins its web site by proclaiming "Praise Yahweh" and its intention to "serve the Lord of Glory and His Holy Race". The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan note that only those of "Christian faith" can be members, and asks every new recruit "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?" The White Camelia Knights of the Ku Klux Klan declare that "at some point God's people must take action in the defense of our Christian, racial and political beliefs". The Camelia KKK website also explicitly states "We base our beliefs on our Biblical interpretations, not ignorance, superstition or blind hatred." How does the Camelia KKK justify its opposition to "race-mixing"? "White Christian Israelites are under God's law and covenant. The other peoples of the earth are under nature's law, which God also created... Nature's law, which is a creation of YAHWEH, dictates that kind reproduce after kind. The different people of the world were never supposed to mix." The Imperial Klans of America declares, "We are a gathering of White Christian men and women." The National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan website declares that they "reverently acknowledge the majesty and supremacy of Almighty God and recognize his goodness and providence through his Son Jesus Christ. We avow the distinction between the races of mankind as decreed by the Lord our God, and we shall ever be true to the maintenance of His Supremacy."

None of these racist websites mentions "Darwin" or "evolution" as a justification for any of their beliefs. All of them talk about "God" and "The Creator" instead.Creationists, Hitler and Evolution

Aryan Nations, which also calls itself the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, begins its web site by proclaiming "Praise Yahweh" and its intention to "serve the Lord of Glory and His Holy Race". The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan note that only those of "Christian faith" can be members, and asks every new recruit "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?" The White Camelia Knights of the Ku Klux Klan declare that "at some point God's people must take action in the defense of our Christian, racial and political beliefs". The Camelia KKK website also explicitly states "We base our beliefs on our Biblical interpretations, not ignorance, superstition or blind hatred." How does the Camelia KKK justify its opposition to "race-mixing"? "White Christian Israelites are under God's law and covenant. The other peoples of the earth are under nature's law, which God also created... Nature's law, which is a creation of YAHWEH, dictates that kind reproduce after kind. The different people of the world were never supposed to mix." The Imperial Klans of America declares, "We are a gathering of White Christian men and women." The National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan website declares that they "reverently acknowledge the majesty and supremacy of Almighty God and recognize his goodness and providence through his Son Jesus Christ. We avow the distinction between the races of mankind as decreed by the Lord our God, and we shall ever be true to the maintenance of His Supremacy."

None of these racist websites mentions "Darwin" or "evolution" as a justification for any of their beliefs. All of them talk about "God" and "The Creator" instead.

Holy Shit.

Have any of you heard of Raelians?

I just googled it.

____________________

Who are the Raelians?

The Raelian movement is the founder of the Clonaid company which claims to have produced the first cloned baby.

The movement claims to have about 40,000 members in several countries, although the number is difficult to verify.

The sect, which believes humans were created by extra-terrestrial beings who had mastered genetic engineering, was founded in France in 1973 by a former journalist who worked for a racing car magazine.

One December morning in 1973, journalist Claude Vorilhon was on his way to work in the French provincial town of Clermont-Ferrand.

But - according to a book written by Mr Vorilhon, who is now known as Rael - instead of going to the office, on an impulse, he drove to a nearby volcano.

International movement

There, he says, he was contacted by an extra-terrestrial being who emerged from a flying saucer and told him - in fluent French - that humans were created in laboratories by people from another planet.

The creators were known as the Elohim - a word which, in ancient Hebrew, meant "those who came from the sky".

It is used in Jewish prayers to refer to God.

Mr Vorilhon was told to spread the word of the Elohim on Earth in preparation for their return.

He describes them as being little over a metre in height, with pale green skin, almond-shaped eyes and long dark hair.

Since then the Raelians have grown into an international movement. Rael himself has reportedly relocated to the United States after complaining of harassment by the French authorities.

Eternal life

The Raelians' interest in cloning seems to stem from their belief that the human soul perishes when the body dies.

Therefore, they believe, the key to eternal life is not the soul but the recreation of individuals from their DNA.

In 1997, the group founded Clonaid, which now says it has cloned a human being.

In 1990, the Raelians changed their symbol, originally a Swastika inside a Star of David.

The idea was to improve relations with Israel and persuade the government there to let them build an embassy for the Elohim in Jerusalem.

I'm not a realian or a rastafarian or any such.

Hitler paid lip service to Christianity but was in no wise a Christian, and the theory of evolution was at the bottom of his ideology.

Christianity cannot serve as a basis for racism; evolution can and does. Even when the Christian world was under threat of extermination by the Mongol and Turkish empires and a little bit of racism would have stood them in good stead they were not able to manage it. So long as Christianity held sway in Europe, racism never had a foothold there.

Newt Gingrich once stated the problem of evolutionism and morality about as succinctly as is possible in noting that the question of whether a man views his neighbor as a fellow child of God or as a meat byproduct of random processes simply has to affect human relationships.

Basically, every halfway honest person with any brains and talent who has taken any sort of a hard look at evolution in the past 60 years has given up on it and many have denounced it. A listing of fifty or sixty such statements makes for an overwhelming indictment of that part of the scientific community which goes on trying to defend evolution and they (the evolosers) have a favorite term ( "quote mining") which they use to describe that sort of argument.

My own response to that is to note what I view as the ultimate evolution quote by the noted evolutionist (actually, FORMER evolutionist) Jeffrey Dahmer:

<quote>
</quote>

Dahmer converted to Christianity before he died. The basic tenets of true religion appear to be inprinted upon most of us biologically which is the only reason that Islammic societies and "secular humanist" societies like Britain and Canada function at all. A psychopath like Dahmer is basically somebody on whom that imprint did not take. For those guys, it has to be written down somewhere, and it has to be written down accurately; the bible does that. Telling somebody like Dahmer that we all evolved from "lucky dust" is a formula for getting people killed.

Evolution was the basic philosophical cornerstone of communism, naziism, the various eugenics programs, the out of control arms races which led to WW-I and WW-II, and all of the grief of the last 150 years. Starting from 1913, Europe had gone for a hundred years without a major war. They didn't even have to think. All they needed to do was act cool, go to church, have parades, formal balls, attend board meetings, and they'd still be running the world today; they'd be so fat and happy they'd not know what to do with themselves. Instead, they all got to reading about Darwinism, fang and claw, survival of the fittest and all the rest of that nonsense, and the rest as they say is history.

The most interesting analysis of that sad tale is probably Sir Arthur Keith's "Evolution and Ethics"

Keith apparently viewed belief in evolution as some sort of duty of the English educated classes, nonetheless he had a very clear vision of the problems inherent in it and laid it out in no uncertain terms:

From Sir Srthur Keith's "Evolution and Ethics:

Chapter 3

The Behavior of Germany Considered from an Evolutionary Point of View in 1942

....It is worth noting that Hitler uses a double designation for his tribal doctrine National Socialism:

Socialism standing for the good side of the tribal spirit (that which works within the Reich); aud Nationalism for the ethically vicious part, which dominates policy at and outside the German frontiers.

The leader of Germany is an evolutionist not only in theory, but, as millions know to their cost, in the rigor of its practice. For him the national "front" of Europe is also the evolutionary "front"; he regards himself, and is regarded, as the incarnation of the will of Germany, the purpose of that will being to guide the evolutionary destiny of its people....

... "Humanitarianism is an evil... a creeping poison." "The most cruel methods are humane if they give a speedy victory" is Hitler's echo of a maxim attributed to Moltke. Such are the ways of evolution when applied to human affairs.

...I have said nothing about the methods employed by the Nazi leaders to secure tribal unity in Germany methods of brutal compulsion, bloody force, and the concentration camp. Such methods cannot be brought within even a Machiavellian system of ethics, and yet may be justified by their evolutionary result.

12.

.... No aspect of Hitler's policy proclaims the antagonism between evolution and ethics so forcibly as his treatment of the Jewish people in Germany.......Hitler is an uncompromising evolutionist, and we must seek for an evolutionary explanation if we are to understand his actions....

It must not be thought that in seeking to explain Hitler's actions I am seeking to justify them. The opposite is the case. I have made this brief survey of public policy in modern Germany with a definite object: to show that Dr. Waddington is in error when he seeks to place ethics on a scientific basis by a knowledge of evolutionary tendencies and practice.

Chapter 4

Human Life: Its Purpose or Ultimate End

IN THE COURSE OF GATHERING INFORMATION concerning man's morality and the part it has played and is playing in his evolution, I found it necessary to provide space for slips which were labeled "Life: Its Ultimate and Proximate Purposes." Only those who have devoted some special attention to this matter are aware of the multitude of reasons given for the appearance of man on earth. Here I shall touch on only a few of them; to deal with all would require a big book. The reader may exclaim: Why deal with any of them! What has ultimate purpose got to do with ethics and evolution! Let a man with a clearer head and a nimbler pen than mine reply. He is Edward Carpenter, who wrote Civilization: Its Cause and Cure (1889).

14.

It is from the sixteenth edition (1923) I am to quote, p. 249:

If we have decided what the final purpose or Life of Man is, then we may say that what is good for that purpose is finally "good" and what is bad for that purpose is finally "evil."

...If the final purpose of our existence is that which has been and is being worked out under the discipline of evolutionary law, then, although we are quite unconscious of the end result, we ought, as Dr. Waddington has urged, to help on "that which tends to promote the ultimate course of evolution." If we do so, then we have to abandon the hope of ever attaining a universal system of ethics; for, as we have just seen, the ways of national evolution, both in the past and in the present, are cruel, brutal, ruthless, and without mercy. Dr. Waddington has not grasped the implications of Nature's method of evolution, for in his summing up (Nature, 1941, 150, p. 535) he writes "that the ethical principles formulated by Christ... are those which have tended towards the further evolution of mankind, and that they will continue to do so." Here a question of the highest interest is raised: the relationship which exists between evolution and Christianity; so important, it seems to me, that I shall devote to it a separate chapter. Meantime let me say that the conclusion I have come to is this:

<quote>
the law of Christ is incompatible with the law of evolution as far as the law of evolution has worked hitherto. Nay, the two laws are at war with each other; the law of Christ can never prevail until the law of evolution is destroyed.

</quote>

All of that, of course, deals only with the question of ethics and the logical consequences of evolutionism. The fact that evolution is junk science argues against it as well.

Mormons believe that prophets and prophesy exist in our own age of the world. In that, there are in the same trickbag which slammites are in.

Joseph Smith in fact claimed to have used prophesy stones (urim) to translate several heiroglyphic documents into basic books of the Mormon religion; real translations of those texts after the Rosetta Stone had been used to get a real handle on heiroglyphics, showed Smith to have been either a con man, somebody totally misguided, or somebody smoking too much reefer. He didn't get a single word of it right.

If natural selection (or even punctuated equilibrium) are clap trap, how come all the evidence doesnt support any form of Creationit belief? Is it perhaps, tat there is no evidence and youre just attempting to keep perping the Creationist fraud on the internet?

Beneficial mutations, trolls, and actual bio research...
gungasnake started this out saying something including...

<quote>
Take "beneficial mutations" for instance. Aside from the fact that they don't really exist, the most common example of such a thing which you hear from the e-losers is sickle-cell anemia, which is supposed to confer some limited immunity from malaria.

Think about that for a minute. I mean, if I'm the chief of some African village, the only thing I could think of worse than having half the village dying of malaria, would be having half the village dying of malaria and the other half dying of sickle-cell anemia.
</quote>

This has to be a troll... because it's just so wrong. To bring it up and then grossly ignore the underlying explanation... But I guess it's not a sin to feed the trolls if you spread accurate and interesting information, right?

*So*...

That would be a quarter (versus everyone) dying of malaria at the cost of a quarter of your children. It's basic genetics. Remember? Punnet squares?

Code: N = Normal allele on one chromosome.
s = Sickle cell allele on one chromosome.

ss = Leads to death by sickle cell anemia.
NN = Leads to death by malaria.
Ns = Leads to dying of something else (hopefully) after reproduction.

Assuming both parents have survived long enough to have children (and hence are Ns) the statistics on the phenotypes of those children are modeled by the following table (each outcome having equal probability).

N s

N NN Ns

s Ns ss

Thus, 2/4 survive, repeating the above travesty of human suffering. 1/4 die of malaria. 1/4 die of sickle cell. (Until we cure malaria and subsidize genetic counseling to edit sickle cell anemia out the the human genome (if I was sitting on the right sub-committees, anyway)).

Sometimes situations like this are called "super dominance". It also accounts for A and B bloodtypes... (this <a href="http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/(geh4qcmwoyrpxa55izdn5055)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,11,14;journal,47,218;linkingpublicationresults,1:102024,1">attempt to model the dynamics</a> is part of the vast literature on the subject).

A really <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/harpend/.Public/AshkenaziIQ.jbiosocsci.pdf">controversial but fascinating application</a> (summarized <a href="http://www.futurepundit.com/archives/002812.html">here</a> ) is to sphingolipid metabolism and apoptosis mechanisms in Ashkenazi Jews during the "career discrimination" they faced in the dark ages. The idea was that the jobs they were stuck with required them to be brainy to get rich and have lots of kids (in a pre-demographic transition society, so: "rich"="more kids", unlike nowadays). This was "like" malaria in creating a huge new selective pressure... the hiccups like breast cancer and Tay Sachs when you get *two* copies of a smarty-gene were due to the selective pressure being very recent and very strong.

However, the whole point is kinda moot considering the better examples of beneficial mutations such as <a href="http://www.science.doe.gov/Science_News/feature_articles_2002/May/Milano_Mutation/Milano%20Mutation.htm">the apoA-I Milano mutation</a> or <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1284595/posts">lactose tolerance</a>.

(Although I have to admit that gunga might have a point about Darwinism being politically dangerous in the hands of philosophically stupid people over long periods of time. Gunga being a perfect example... unless the old "no daddy in the sky means no reason to be moral" thing he got into later is just part of the troll.)

You don't seem to grasp the point. The point is, that in theory, there could be a population of apes, and every once in a while one of the apes gets a "beneficial mutation(TM)", and by and by, without anybody ever having noticed anything unusual, about 10,000,000 yeas later, you have a population of humans.

But in real life, the best example of a "beneficial mutation(TM)" anybody can produce, is sickle-cell anemia.

Who precisely do you contend claims that sickle cell anemia is a beneficial mutation?

You perverted the story considerably, as we expect from Gunga Din. For example, one is not faced with a choice between seeing people die of malaria or die of sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia does not entail a sudden onset which swiftly kills those who have the condition. Malaria does not necessarily kill, either. Additionally, malaria, which originated in the Mediterranean, and was spread across southern Europe and Northern Africa by the Romans, did not spread across the Sahara because of a lack of the necessary conditions to support the plasmodia.

Malaria was contracted by Cordoba's tercios in the wars of King Carlos--who was idiotically elected Holy Roman Emperor by German Electors who succumbed to his bribery. In the fighting in Italy, the Spaniard contracted malaria, and carried it to the Indies, both East and West. It did not enter subsaharan Africa to stay until the late 19th century.

Prior to that time, those who were taken to the West Indies to work the sugar plantations died in droves. At first, these were European peasants. The combination of the climate and malaria killed them in their thousands, literally. The Arawak tribes of Amerindians fared no better--although aclimatized, the malaria carried them off faster than Europeans, most of whom had inherited a resistance to the devestation of the liver which kills most swiftly.

Sickle cell anemia is endemic in only certain regions of the globe, such as the Korean penninsula and west Africa. West African negroes who were transported to the West Indies as slaves tended to survive the brutal labor conditions of the sugar cane brakes because they were inured to the heat and humidity, and because of a propensity to sickle cell anemia. The quaternary stage of the life cycle of the plasmodium which causes malaria is the colonization of red blood cells. This effect was greatly reduced in those with sickle cell anemia, and the successful colonization of the liver by the plasmodium usually failed. Niether malaria nor the sickly cell anemia killed the West African Negro, although either or the combination of both would ennervate them, giving rise to a stereotype of laziness.

Basically, the dynamic of malaria and sickle cell anemia is one of the most striking examples of evolution in action for which the historical record provides an example. West African negroes became the slaves of choice by default--they survived when other alborers--whites, blacks and even imported Chinese "coolies" did not. The slave trade on the coast of what would become the United States originated in the West Indies, so that the concentrated genetic propensity for sickle cell anemia was transferred to America.

I know of no one so idiotic as to suggest that this is a "beneficial mutation." Anyone who makes such a suggestion obviously has their head up their ass. Anyone who attempts to use such a claim in a feeble and dull-witted attempt to discredit a theory of evolution is equally deluded and stupid.

Sickle-cell is not a good example of a beneficial mutation.

Although, I did read a recent article that argued that evolution is still happening in humanity, although the evolutionary trend is towards more intelligent people (either that or tests are dumbing down).

Of course, to predict evolution is a fruitless exercise. You cannot predict evolution.

Some of you experts might want to read through the list and see which of them you think you might derive some "benefit" from...

That's a list of genetic disorders. It says so right in the title. These mutations stand out because they are dramatically harmful. But every receptor that's got an extra couple of amino acids at the end, every different MHC locus is the result of mutation. If all mutations are so harmful, why is there so much variability in the genome of every critter that walks, oozes, swims, or flies across the earth?

Variation in alleles and microevolution cause the sort of variation you speak of and are not part of the debate on the THEORY of evolution, which involves macroevolution. Real mutations, in real life, cause debility and death, as the website notes.

No, it's not. I pointed out to you the mutation in which the CCR5 receptor is missing. That's beneficial in that it gives protection against HIV infection. That is an even better example of a beneficial mutation.

Funny thing, every one of these "beneficial mutations" involves some sort of loss of function or capacity; in this case, having some normal function missing prevents AIDS from catching on.

Problem is, you develop immunity to four or five diseases in such fashion, and your nose will fall off, your ears, your arms, legs, your ass......

Likewise in the claims of microorganisms developing immunity to antibiotics via some such "beneficial mutation" in which information is lost. That's why doctors sometimes treat diseases with several antibiotics. The microbe loses so much information in evolving to deal with them, that it dies.

That (dying) is supposed to be beneficial in the world of the evo-loser.

Like Gracie says, "One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small....."

Loss of CCR5 is not detrimental to all. Evolution does not necessarily imply a gain of function, something you fail to comprehend. It means any change that will be beneficial. If losing some function is beneficial then so be it.

No. The doctors treat diseases with several antibiotics for the same reason the US military did carpet bombing in Afghanistan. You hit one place, sure you're likely to kill an Insurgent, but if you hit all the surrounding areas as well, you're more likely to kill them all.

It's not about causing them to mutate. It's about hitting them with everything you've got. Hitting them with so many different antibiotics, that you're bound to kill them with one of them.

If the ONLY way you can gain anything from evolution is via loss of information, and that does appear to be the case, then the theory of evolution basically doesn't work. All you have is a theory of DEvolution.

You still don't get it, do you?

If its a mutation via loss of information, that's still evolution. It doesn't matter if we lose genes or gain genes, as long as its beneficial to us, its evolution. Or are you deliberately choosing not to understand?

You don't know much about evolution, do you?

Fine. If you want a gain of function mutation, then try this:
<a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/23/1/46">http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/23/1/46</a>

I'm going in search for more and that means delving into PubMed and searching journal after journal article for the stuff you want. Just because you can't find a good example, doesn't mean there isn't one.

Or perhaps I should take the example of the others and leave this topic well alone. There's no use in trying to prove you wrong.

Thing is, I don't want him having the last word and I don't want him going away thinking he's "won" this "debate".

The problem with evolution, however, is that the anti-Evolutionists attack almost anything that supports evolution. So in order to counter their arguments, you have to have knowledge in geology, genetics, taxonomy and a whole wide range of other subjects that I can't quite remember the names of, in order to successfully argue against them.

That means it requires a whole load of us to counter one guy's arguments and preferably each one of us must have an expertise in one of the many fields said guy is attacking.

It's exhausting.

That the theory of evolution is a bunch of bullshit.

You are wrong. This is a PERFECT example of natural selection in action.

the sickle cells stop plasmodium from being able to replicate thus preventing the disease.

If an individual is homozygous for the recessive sickle cells, they shall have the chronic disease and will die young. But if an individual is hetrozygous for the normal cell and sickle then they shall have immunity but bu untouched by the disease. In this case Natural selection shall favour these people over those who do not have the recessive gene.

<post author="gungasnake" datetime="2006-05-05T21:16:00" id="p90">
The problem is, that sickle cell is one of the two or three examples of a "beneficial mutation" anybody can name and, aside from the obvious fact that it does not lead to anything remotely resembling macroevolution, it amounts fo another way of having large numbers of people die.

Sickle cell is normally described as a genetic disorder.

Another way to look at it is that, if you're the chief of an African village, having large numbers of people lying around dead from sickle cell disease is basically not a good thing.

Hey gunga, if you're half dying from malaria, and half dying from sickle-cell, you're not dead yet, only dying, and that means you can have kids. Whereas, if you're dead from malaria or dead from sickle-cell anemia, you can't. Beneficial mutation my friend.

<post author="FreeThought" datetime="2006-05-05T21:26:00" id="p92">
yes but if u look at the punnet square for a couple who are both hetrozygous for the recessive allele then u weill see it is a 2:1:1 probability (hetrozygous, homozygous for dominant trait, homozygous for recessive trait)

so there is only a 25% chance the individual will have homozygous recessive trait, ie, acute sickle cell an...

so it is a beneficial mutation thus natural selection acts in its favour. EVOLUTION in process.
