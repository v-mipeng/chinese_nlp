<P>
A new game plan
</P>
<P>
MEMPHIS - UFC 107 is in the history books and everyone is ready
to move
on.
</P>
<P>
Kenny Florian, a Dover, Mass., native who earned an impressive
victory
over Clay Guida Saturday night in the lightweight division, will
take time
off to recharge before getting back in the gym with his coaches -
Firas
Zahabi, his brother Keith Florian, and boxing specialist Peter
Welch.
</P>
<P>
Florian, 33, clearly had a different game plan than he had in
losing to
UFC lightweight champion B.J. Penn in August. (Penn retained the
championship belt Saturday with a dominating performance over Diego
Sanchez.) Although he started cautiously, Florian adjusted and went
after
Guida, who tapped out at 2:19 of the second round as a result of a
rear
naked choke.
</P>
<P>
In the first round, Florian, who is known for razor-sharp
elbows, opened a
deep gash in Guida's scalp, causing profuse bleeding.
</P>
<P>
In the second, Florian followed with a strike to Guida's chin
that dropped
him to the floor of the octagon, where he was finished off.
</P>
<P>
"((It)) was my night," said Florian. "Clay Guida is a
phenomenal
fighter. I wanted to go out there and take my time. Peter Welch and
Firas
Zahabi really improved my striking. I'm trying to get better, I
want
another shot at the title."
</P>
<P>
Florian's enhanced boxing skills were evident throughout the
fight.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get in there and trade a little bit and put on a
good show
for the fans, and really implement my game," he said. "I wanted
to be
aggressive and get back to being the Kenny Florian that people know
me
for."
</P>
<P>
The strategy was to chip away at Guida using short strikes,
which worked.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get them in tight," said Florian. "That was kind
of the
theme for this fight. It was an elbow that really cut him very bad
inside.
The key really was mixing it up on Clay.
</P>
<P>
"I was able to do that and I caught him with a nice elbow that
cut him
open and rocked him, and the finisher was a strike that set up the
big
right hook. It was a short right hook that caught him right on the
button.
He went face-first into the canvas and I knew it was my time to
capitalize."

<P>
UFC president Dana White's next event is UFC 108 in Las Vegas
Jan. 2, but
because Massachusetts has become the latest state to regulate mixed
martial
arts, the former Boston resident already is plotting a card for the
Hub in
August.
</P>
<P>
"To try to explain to you in words how excited I am to go to
Boston, I
couldn't," said White. "It's really important to me and it means
a lot.
I'm excited to go to Boston Garden. I've even toyed with Fenway
Park and
Fenway loves the idea. I'm going to bring a sick, sick fight card
to
Boston. I'm going to do some serious ((stuff)), stuff I haven't
done
anywhere else because it's a big deal for me. It's going to be a
big
splash."
</P>
<P>
He said he expects nothing less than an enthusiastic response.
</P>
<P>
"The great thing about Boston and New England is, Boston pulls
((fans))
from Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island.
People will
come in from New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
"All those people will come to that fight plus the people who
come from
all over the world. It's going to be a crazy event. We'll be there
in the
summertime. It's going to be great."
