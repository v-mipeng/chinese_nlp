A yachtswoman on Monday became the first  quadriplegic woman to sail solo around
Britain, arriving in Dover to cheers from wellwishers.
</P>
<P>
Hilary Lister, 37, sailed into Dover harbour in southeast England after the
40-day trip in her specially adapted boat.
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely amazing. It's great to be back in Dover and to have completed
the trip, the dream," Lister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I can't quite believe I've done it to be honest."
</P>
<P>
After enjoying sports as a child, Lister was diagnosed with a degenerative
disease which gradually limited the use of her body.
</P>
<P>
She had to adapt to adulthood being able to only move her head, eyes and mouth,
but her life changed when she discovered sailing in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Her mother Pauline Rudd said: "It is a staggering achievement, technically apart
from anything else.
</P>
<P>
"Not only for her but for the whole crew who deserve a lot of recognition. To be
able to do this when she is in so much pain and so dependent is a huge
undertaking."
</P>
<P>
Lister operated the boat using three straws connected to sensitive pressure
switches. A "sip" on one straw caused the boat to go to starboard, while a
"puff" took the boat to port.
</P>
<P>
The second straw controlled the winch motor for both sails in a similar fashion.
The third straw allowed Lister to control her autopilot, to trim one sail
relative to the other and raise or lower the height of the boom.
