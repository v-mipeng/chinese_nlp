NOAA: This year warmest on record so far

So far, this has been the hottest year in recorded history.

On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released new data showing that, from January to July, the average global temperature was 58.1 degrees. That was 1.22 degrees over the average from the 20th century, and the hottest since 1880, when reliable records begin.

And, while NOAA experts say global climate change isn't the only reason that 2010 has been so hot--an El Nino event earlier in the year pushed temperatures up--it's still the most important reason.

One of the primary predictions of global warming is that the weather swings will be wider and wilder, with an overall warming trend.

There were places in the US that had a very cold winter, that are now having a record summer heat wave. We shall see what the average is for the continents at the end of the year. Right now, we have had a year that is in contention with 1998 for the warmest year on record.

Shall we be a bit more accurate when we are throwing numbers around? 4.53 billion years. And in that time, there have been several extinction events caused by rapid natural increases in GHGs. The physics of such events care nothing at all as to whether the increase in GHGs is natural or man caused, the results will be the same.

The science and the scientists are completely clear on this subject. We are creating another great extinction, and while man as a species may survive, the world we know today will be gone forever. That is going to be your legacy, your gift to your descendents.

There is not one single extinction event attributed to global warming. Even your PETM wiki entry admits that fact. I have highlighted the relevant sections for the willfully ignorant....that would be you od fraud, Chris, konrad et al.

The PETM is accompanied by a mass extinction of 35-50% of benthic foraminifera (especially in deeper waters) over the course of ~1,000 years - the group suffering more than during the dinosaur-slaying K-T extinction. Contrarily, planktonic foraminifera diversified, and dinoflagellates bloomed. Success was also enjoyed by the mammals, who radiated profusely around this time.

The deep-sea extinctions are difficult to explain, as many were regional in extent (mainly affecting the north Atlantic); this means that we cannot appeal to general hypotheses such as a temperature-related reduction in oxygen availability, or increased corrosiveness due to carbonate-undersaturated deep waters. The only factor which was global in extent was an increase in temperature, and it appears that the majority of the blame must rest upon its shoulders. Regional extinctions in the North Atlantic can be attributed to increased deep-sea anoxia, which could be due to the slowdown of overturning ocean currents,[10] or the release and rapid oxidation of large amounts of methane.[23][verification needed]

In shallower waters, it's undeniable that increased CO2 levels result in a decreased oceanic pH, which has a profound negative effect on corals.[24] Experiments suggest it is also very harmful to calcifying plankton.[25] However, the strong acids used to simulate the natural increase in acidity which would result from elevated CO2 concentrations may have given misleading results, and the most recent evidence is that coccolithophores (E. huxleyi at least) become more, not less, calcified and abundant in acidic waters.[ 26] Interestingly, no change in the distribution of calcareous nanoplankton such as the coccolithophores can be attributed to acidification during the PETM.[26] Acidification did lead to an abundance of heavily calcified algae[27] and weakly calcified forams.[28]

The increase in mammalian abundance is intriguing. There is no evidence of any increased extinction rate among the terrestrial biota. Increased CO2 levels may have promoted dwarfing[29]  which may (perhaps?) have encouraged speciation. Many major mammalian orders  including the Artiodactyla, horses, and primates  appeared and spread across the globe 13,000 to 22,000 years after the initiation of the PETM.[29]

That a species is wiped out because the human population has encroached on its habitat certainly is not the same as a species disappearing because of climate.

And I haven't denied anything. The earth is very slightly warmer than it was a century ago. I just don't believe that a few degrees difference in temps is a catastrophe.

The physics of the situation cares not at all what you believe.

A few degrees warmer means that feedbacks kick in that will make it more than just a few degrees warmer. And many species, already under stress from our population, will find their niche gone. So even as the human population undergoes a rapid diminishment, the other species will be doing the same, many to the point of extinction.

No bigger than assuming it won't! The problem isn't the few degrees, but the amplification of heat as higher temps lead to more vapor in the atmosphere and then, as we're told every day because water is the major GHG, MORE HEAT!!!

prove how hotter temps will kill off people.

Sea levels might rise but people will move. You cannot prove there will be famine or catastrophe. For all you know more people will experience longer more temperate growing seasons allowing food to be grown more abundantly in places.

I can just a easily say the more water vapor in the atmosphere will create more clouds and those clouds will reflect a great deal of solar radiation.

So stop the chicken little, we're all going to die shit. People will survive even though you believe it benefits you to think they won't

Well you can scratch desertification off of your list of "global warming" problems. Highlighted in blue per usual.

Desertification is the process which turns productive into non- productive desert as a result of poor land-management. Desertification occurs mainly in semi-arid areas (average annual rainfall less than 600 mm) bordering on deserts. In the Sahel, (the semi-arid area south of the Sahara Desert), for example, the desert moved 100 km southwards between 1950 and 1975.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT CAUSES DESERTIFICATION?
* Overgrazing is the major cause of desertification worldwide. Plants of semi-arid areas are adapted to being eaten by sparsely scattered, large, grazing mammals which move in response to the patchy rainfall common to these regions. Early human pastoralists living in semi-arid areas copied this natural system. They moved their small groups of domestic animals in response to food and water availability. Such regular stock movement prevented overgrazing of the fragile plant cover.

In modern times, the use of fences has prevented domestic and wild animals from moving in response to food availability, and overgrazing has often resulted. However, when used correctly, fencing is a valuable tool of good veld management.

The use of boreholes and windmills also allows livestock to stay all-year round in areas formerly grazed only during the rains when seasonal pans held water. Where not correctly planned and managed, provision of drinking water has contributed to the massive advance of deserts in recent years as animals gather around waterholes and overgraze the area.

* Cultivation of marginal lands, i.e lands on which there is a high risk of crop failure and a very low economic return, for example, some parts of South Africa where maize is grown.

* Destruction of vegetation in arid regions, often for fuelwood.

* Poor grazing management after accidental burning of semi-arid vegetation.

* Incorrect irrigation practices in arid areas can cause salinization, (the build up of salts in the soil) which can prevent plant growth.

When the practices described above coincide with drought, the rate of desertification increases dramatically.

Increasing human population and poverty contribute to desertification as poor people may be forced to overuse their environment in the short term, without the ability to plan for the long term effects of their actions. Where livestock has a social importance beyond food, people might be reluctant to reduce their stock numbers.

40% of the phytoplankton are gone in the ocean. Acidification? Increased temperatures? Pollution? We don't know, but a loss that big at the base of the oceanic food chain is rather significant, to say nothing of the role phytoplankton play in the production of oxygen.

Now we are seeing increased frequencies of precipitation events, as well as more severe and frequent heat waves. Exactly as predicted by the climatologists.

While the global rise in mean day/night and seasonal air temperatures (ATE) of recent decades is well documented, its influence on levels of soil-sequestered organic carbon, and on emission rates of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emanating therefrom, is only beginning to garner serious attention. This has resulted in a limited but growing understanding, particularly in the context of the lands of the Chinese subcontinent, of the mechanisms underlying such emissions. Some 340 soil samples from 12 different sandy land regions in China were analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Stepwise regression identified correlations between SOC and a number of climatic factors measured at the sampling sites: winter, summer, nighttime and daytime ATE, and precipitation. In desertified lands, net SOC losses showed a direct correlation with precipitation but no significant relationship with mean ATE. However, in northwest and northeast China, decreases in SOC were linked to rises in day/night and seasonal ATE, while in north central China they were linked to a rise in mean ATE. Between 1900 and 1998, mean ATE in the northwest, northeast, and north central regions rose by 0.14E, 0.28E, and 0.15E decade−1, respectively. Meanwhile, precipitation dropped by 25 mm decade−1 across these regions. In this study, day/night and seasonal ATE showed differing levels of significance with respect to their linear relationships with SOC content. Driven by rises in day/night and seasonal ATE, long-term alterations to global ecosystemic processes, particularly the carbon cycle, may quantitatively and qualitatively alter the flora of desertified ecosystems. Our study suggests that, over the last 40 years, anthropogenic factors, precipitation, and rises in ATE (particularly nighttime and winter) have contributed 47%, 26%, and 20%, respectively, of greenhouse gas emissions from SOC. It is apparent that for China's desertified lands, human activity is the primary causative factor in the release of SOC-derived greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, while geography and climatic extremes individually play a lesser role.

In Texas...

Houston will likely record its highest ever monthly temperature this August.

Through Thursday the city’s average temperature of 88.3 degrees this month is nearly a full degree above the hottest months on record — July 1980 and August 1962 — which each reached 87.5 degrees.

“At this point I’m fairly confident that this August is going to be the warmest month of all time,” said Chuck Roeseler, a senior forecaster with the Houston/Galveston office of the National Weather Service.

Although temperatures may moderate by the middle of next week, this weekend should be brutally hot.

Daytime highs will crest near 100 degrees as a high-pressure system keeps the mercury up. Overnight lows are likely to remain near 80 degrees.

It is this inability of temperatures to cool down overnight that has led to this month’s record warmth.

Prior to this summer, just once in the city’s 110-plus years of records had a daily minimum temperature ever bottomed out at 83 degrees in August.

If it seems like air conditioners have been cranking much more than usual the past few months and people have been sweating more outside, there’s a simple explanation: This summer officially went down as the hottest on record in New Jersey.

With the mercury first hitting 90 degrees on April 7, not a month has passed in which the Garden State hasn’t reached or topped that steamy temperature at least once, said David Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University.

"We’ve really been baking in summers in New Jersey, and never more so than this summer,’’ Robinson said.

You might want to check what you post before you lie about it, Walleyes. And, yes, once again I am pointing out that you are a liar. For here is the first few sentences of the article that you posted;

Houston has been oh-so-close to triple digits this summer, hitting 99 degrees on four separate days.

Although it could do so this weekend, the official thermometer at George Bush Intercontinental has not yet tickled 100 degrees.

If Houston can continue to dance just under the century mark for a few more weeks, it will pass as the first summer in more than a decade without a 100-degree day.

That would be especially surprising given that August has been a real scorcher.

With an average temperature of 88.1 degrees, this month currently is on pace to be the warmest August on record in Houston.

Although the city hasn't had a summer without a 100-degree day since 1997, it wasn't always this way.

From the 1890s through the 1990s, Houston typically had five years each decade when the maximum temperature never broke triple digits.

"I'd say urbanization has had a minor effect, maybe a degree or two on the hottest days," he said. "Likewise, Texas temperatures are overall warmer than they were for most of the previous century, contributing another degree or two on most days. Weather randomness also contributes to streaks such as this. So I'd apportion the blame equally among local urbanization, global warming and random luck."

Yeah it's called weather. Just imagine you were a cat. A cat lives for between 15 and 20 years. So if you were a cat watching you grow up you would see the 3 years of toddlerdome, the next five years of beginning to learn, and if you were lucky the next 12 years of you becoming an adult and finally making your own way in the world. But you as a cat would pass away before ever seeing what sort of life you lived, what sort of family you raised, what impact you had on the world.

Now think about this. To the world we're not even cats. We're not even fruitflys (who live 24 hours or so), we are around for such a vanishingly short time that we have no reference for how slowly the planet lives and breathes. Events that occured 1000 years ago are only now being felt today. Some cycles are even longer.

That is the point that I am making.

It's like the hottest summer ever, right?

Meteorological summer 2010, from June 1 through Aug. 31, will indeed go down in the record book with hottest average temperature on record.

No it wasn't the hottest summer ever. In some places it was certainly hot but interestingly enough it was cooler in more areas than it was hot. Also when you take out the false satellite data it was actually fairly cool overall. Then add in the fact that the only weather stations the alarmists chose to use are the ones with the highest levels of urban heat island effect and no it wasn't all that hot.

(WLTX) - The hottest months of the year are finally at an end and it's official - 2010 was the hottest summer ever for Columbia.

This summer was so extraordinary, one could easily write a small book on the summer of 2010. But, in an effort to save time (and boredom), we'll hit the highlights of this summer instead...

We all realize that this summer was a hot one, but it's hard to put in perspective how impressive this season really was. When compared to the other top 10 warmest summers, 1.27 degrees doesn't seem like much. But, in the statistical world of meteorology, this is huge. Breaking a record that spans 92 days by even 1/2 a degree would be significant, let alone what was accomplished this season. Mathematically, we can say that we have officially crushed the record.

Sorry Old Rocks, here you go

Station Set
oC/Century, 11-Year Average Based on the Use of

Raw Data
Adjusted Data

Rural (48)
0.11
0.58

Urban (48)
0.72
0.72

Rural + Urban (96)
0.47
0.65

The values in the table highlight four important considerations:

1) The rate of increase for rural locations, based on as-measured (raw) values, is small
(if not, in effect, zero) at 0.11 oC/century.

2) There is definitely a UHIE in that the urban raw data has a rate of increase of 0.72oC/century. This tells us that man has caused warming in urban locations. This finding should not surprise anyone. On the other hand, because the rural value is 15% of the urban value, the UHIE has not caused warming in the rural locations, and it certainly has not caused a global sense of warming other than the aspect that the urban location values when averaged with the rural values produce an average increase which is larger than that of the rural alone.

3) The rural + urban value for the adjusted data, 0.65oC/century, is still less than the 0.69oC/century published by the NCDC. Thus, likely, there are more urban than rural sites used by the NCDC.

4) And this is the "Temperaturegate" aspect: The NCDC's massaging -- they call it "adjusting" -- has resulted in an increase in the rural values, from a raw value of 0.11oC/century to an adjusted value of 0.58oC/century, and no change in the urban values. That is, the NCDC's treatment has forced the rural value to look more like that of the urban. This is the exact opposite of any rational consideration, given the growth of the sizes of and activities within urban locations, unless deception is the goal.

EDIT: Wow! I followed links back and forth from the original article and found out a lot about Jones and his odd computations about Russian temps. His 1990 study showing that Urban Heat Island effect is negligible doesn't seem to match up with his later work that shows a large warming for Russia. Things that make you go hmmmm......
Do you want the links for those too, Old Rocks?

Nature vented a hellacious summer on the Treasure Coast.

The area set an all-time three-month heat record: averaging 83.1 degrees, including nighttime temperatures, from June through August.

On the official record “thermometer,” the mercury edged out the prior record, set in 1998, by 0.4 degrees, according to the National Weather Service in Melbourne.

But that was enough.

The figures are for the federal agency’s weather station in Vero Beach. The Weather Service doesn’t make historical comparisons of temperature records for the other Treasure Coast counties. Indian River County’s temperatures are considered typical of what happens in the other two because of its proximity.

This summer’s high and low temperatures each were the second hottest on record: 91.4 degrees during the day and 74.8 degrees at night. The combination was the highest ever, based on records dating to 1942.

Sorry Old Rocks, here you go

Station Set
oC/Century, 11-Year Average Based on the Use of

Raw Data
Adjusted Data

Rural (48)
0.11
0.58

Urban (48)
0.72
0.72

Rural + Urban (96)
0.47
0.65

The values in the table highlight four important considerations:

1) The rate of increase for rural locations, based on as-measured (raw) values, is small
(if not, in effect, zero) at 0.11 oC/century.

2) There is definitely a UHIE in that the urban raw data has a rate of increase of 0.72oC/century. This tells us that man has caused warming in urban locations. This finding should not surprise anyone. On the other hand, because the rural value is 15% of the urban value, the UHIE has not caused warming in the rural locations, and it certainly has not caused a global sense of warming other than the aspect that the urban location values when averaged with the rural values produce an average increase which is larger than that of the rural alone.

3) The rural + urban value for the adjusted data, 0.65oC/century, is still less than the 0.69oC/century published by the NCDC. Thus, likely, there are more urban than rural sites used by the NCDC.

4) And this is the "Temperaturegate" aspect: The NCDC's massaging -- they call it "adjusting" -- has resulted in an increase in the rural values, from a raw value of 0.11oC/century to an adjusted value of 0.58oC/century, and no change in the urban values. That is, the NCDC's treatment has forced the rural value to look more like that of the urban. This is the exact opposite of any rational consideration, given the growth of the sizes of and activities within urban locations, unless deception is the goal.

Let's see, one cherry picked urban and one cherry picked rural station overrides all other ground stations combined. BRILLIANT

One question, how do you deniers explain the fact that the ground station data matches almost exactly the satellite data collected by deniers Spencer and Christy at UAH???? There is no UHIE in space so that excuse does not cut it with satellites and Christy and Spencer are not going to fudge the numbers in favor of global warming especially since they got caught fudging the numbers AGAINST global warming!!!!

If they are from the American Thinker, no. That is not a serious publication. On the par with the Weekly Globe. In it, politics are far more important than reality. Now if you wish to present some articles from Science, Nature, Journal of Geophysics, ect. then I will be quite willing to read your links.

Ian, scientists examine evidence and draw conclusions from that evidence. Those conclusions are not always correct, and there is as much glory in science for showing where the logic went wrong from the evidence to the conclusion as there is for the original conclusion. Were the evidence for AGW as shaky as the political writers claim, the young turks in the scientific community would have already exposed that.

So, exactly what planet do you live on? The entire fleet of NOAA satellites was reading higher temps than were actually happening. One of which was a 600 degree reading in the arctic!

I love it!

Back when Christy and Spencer were cooking the satellite data to contradict global warming by using the opposite sign to correct for diurnal satellite drift, deniers said their UAH satellite data was the ONLY accurate data. Now that they can't use the opposite sign any more, suddenly no satellite data is accurate any more.

Apparently satellite data is accurate beyond question when it goes against global warming but absolutely worthless when the same data supports global warming. A deniers catch 22. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

TAMPA - Even for Floridians accustomed to summers of brutal and relentless heat, this has been a summer like few in the Tampa Bay area have seen.

Statistics prove it.

This year produced the hottest May through August ever recorded at a number of locations, including Tampa.

Until this year, the hottest stretch of those four months in Tampa was 1998.

It also was the hottest May through August for St. Petersburg, Lakeland, Inverness and tied for hottest in Sarasota. It was the second hottest in Brooksville.

And August's average temperature of 84.4 degrees looks like it will end up tied with 1951 for the fourth-hottest August in Tampa since records started in 1890. The warmest August in Tampa was 1941 at 85.1 degrees.

That follows the fourth-hottest May, second-hottest June and third-hottest July on record in Tampa.

Tampa wasn't alone in the sauna.

August was among the top 10 hottest Augusts in Lakeland, St. Petersburg and Sarasota, and looks to be the hottest August on record for Inverness.

The heat was unrelenting. The average temperature in Tampa was higher than normal for 24 days in August, according to National Weather Service records.

Meteorologists point to a dome of high pressure that hunkered over not just Florida, but the entire Southeast since before summer started and stubbornly remained in place.

Not as many clouds form to provide shade from the pounding afternoon sun. Air sinks under high pressure and grows warmer as it descends. The lack of clouds translates into fewer cooling afternoon thunderstorms.

Normally the high pressure shifts more to the north as summer drags on, but it stayed in place this year.

Mornings when low temperatures stayed in the high 70s or even low 80s also contributed.

Warm starts to the morning make it easier for temperatures to rise into the middle or even high 90s by afternoon instead of staying in the low 90s where they're supposed to be.

The weather service tracks monthly records by averaging each day's highs and lows, so warmer mornings also drive up the average.

There may be a bit of relief in the next few days, even if only temporarily.

Some dry air is filtering over the state, bringing a slight drop to humidity levels. Daytime temperatures over the next few days should hover in the low 90s, where they are supposed to be at this time of year.

But the biggest change could be in the mornings when the lows might drop to the lower 70s and even high 60s in counties away from the coast.

OK, ideas stand on their own. So what does the American Thinker present to counter the fact that CO2 absorbs IF in certain bands? After all, the work of Tyndall and the physicists that have come after him since 1858, can be challenged by anyone that has the good evidence. But you publish such evidence in a science journal. While the evidence might be correct, publishing it in a political journal, is hardly connecting with scientists.

Now Dr. Roy Spencer does not think that the feedback effects of global warming are nearly as serious as Dr. James Hansen believes they are. So he has written, and had accepted, an article concerning that subject in the Journal of Geophysical Research. A peer reviewed scientific journal. And has gotten considerable response to his article. That is how science is done.

You do not publish serious scientific papers in political journals. Just as one would not expect to see an article on political subjects in a scientific journal.

The mercury on Sunday soared to a temple-scorching 39.9 degrees (104 F) in Kyotanabe, Kyoto Prefecture, resetting the record for highest temperature this summer, the Meteorological Agency said.

It was also the highest temperature ever recorded in the month of September. The previous record, 39.7, was logged in Kumagaya, Saitama Prefecture, on Sept. 2, 2000, the agency said.

This summer is definitely one for the record books: It will go down as the hottest in 107 years, when the first temperatures in Henderson County were recorded.

The average temperature for June, July and August was 75.4 degrees, recorded at the Asheville Regional Airport in Fletcher, said Doug Outlaw, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Greer. That average temperature tops the National Weather Service’s records that date back to 1903.

Smart enough to look at the page that points out the source of the article. Which is the Science and Public Policy Institute. Another Conservative bullshit site. Not a peer reviewed article at all.

<a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Science_and_Public_Policy_Institute">Science and Public Policy Institute - SourceWatch</a>

Origin of SPPI
The initial media release of the Institute appears to have been issued on June 1, 2007. The release -- supporting the statements made by the then NASA Administrator Michael Griffin questioning global warming -- also listed Harriette Johnson from the Chicago-based think thank, the Heartland Institute as a media contact.[4]

From mid-July 2007 SPPI began publishing SPPI eWire, which is identical in content style to CSPP's Climate Weekly, Climate and Environment Weekly and Climate and Environment Review.[5] (SPPI is in the same building as CSPP, though in different offices - SPPI at Suite 299).[6] and CPPR at Suite 2100.

From his conclusions, I would have to assume it is just the 'urban' glaciers then that are melting.

<a href="http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/images/stories/papers/originals/Rate_of_Temp_Change_Raw_and_Adjusted_NCDC_Data.pdf">http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/im..._NCDC_Data.pdf</a>

SUMMARY
Both raw and adjusted data from the NCDC has been examined for a selected Contiguous U. S. set of rural and urban stations, 48 each or one per State. The raw data provides 0.13 and 0.79 oC/century temperature increase for the rural and urban environments. The adjusted data provides 0.64 and 0.77 oC/century respectively. The rates for the raw data appear to correspond to the historical change of rural and urban U. S. populations and indicate warming is due to urban warming. Comparison of the adjusted data for the rural set to that of the raw data shows a systematic treatment that causes the rural adjusted set’s temperature rate of increase to be 5-fold more than that of the raw data. The adjusted urban data set’s and raw urban data set’s rates of temperature increase are the same. This suggests the consequence of the NCDC’s protocol for adjusting the data is to cause historical data to take on the time-line characteristics of urban data. The consequence intended or not, is to report a false rate of temperature increase for the Contiguous U. S.

This month the crew has been putting those practices into use as Shreveport experiences near-record heat and a drop in its normal monthly rainfall. The dry weather conditions also have prompted burn bans in Bossier, Caddo, DeSoto and Webster parishes.

There have been many days this month when the temperature has come close to the record temperature for that day, said Matthew Duplantis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Shreveport.

"We were sitting close on most days to reaching those records," he said. The high in Shreveport on Sept. 18 was one degree shy of the record high of 101.

The city of Greenwood is one location that has experienced some of the hottest weather over the past several days with 4 consecutive days of record breaking temperatures with a high of 98 degrees on Friday, 99 degrees on Saturday and 100 degrees on Sunday and Monday.

Other locations that have tied or broken at least one daily record high temperature over the last several days include Tupelo, Philadelphia, Carthage, Cleveland, Independence, Rolling Fork, Stoneville, Hickory Flat, Tunica, Hattiesburg, Columbus, Yazoo City and Vicksburg.

One of the primary predictions of global warming is that there will be wider and wilder swings in the weather, with an overall warming trend.

Good article. Thank you.

Seems that there is some disagreement among the physicists on how to interpret the data.

<a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/42649">Records reveal robust ocean warming - physicsworld.com</a>

'Consistent' with global warming
After gaining an understanding of the sources of uncertainty in each OHCA curve, the team was able to combine the data to obtain a curve that is more representative of global ocean temperature than its constituents. It reveals that the oceans have warmed at a rate of about 0.64 ± 0.11 W/m2 over the past 16 years. According to Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, this is "reasonably consistent with expectations from other indications of global warming".

However, the re-analysis sheds little light on why ocean temperatures appear to have remained steady since about 2004. This is at odds with satellite measurements, which suggest the Earth has continued to heat up over the past six years, leading to questions over where the "missing heat" has gone.

Indeed, Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at Potsdam University near Berlin, says that the new study does solve this problem. "The accuracy of measurements is still not sufficient to close the energy budget particularly for short-term variations, in other words, over a few years, as associated with El Niño".

The Triad tied a yearly record of 64 days of temperatures 90 degrees or above when it hit 91 degrees yesterday at Piedmont Triad International Airport.

The record was set in 2007, the National Weather Service in Raleigh said. Before that, the year with the most days of 90-degree or higher temperatures was 58 days in 1933.

The current record of 90-plus days in the Triad could be surpassed, with high temperatures of 90 or above forecast through Saturday, a weather service website said.

NOAA: This year warmest on record so far

So far, this has been the hottest year in recorded history.

On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released new data showing that, from January to July, the average global temperature was 58.1 degrees. That was 1.22 degrees over the average from the 20th century, and the hottest since 1880, when reliable records begin.

And, while NOAA experts say global climate change isn't the only reason that 2010 has been so hot--an El Nino event earlier in the year pushed temperatures up--it's still the most important reason.

in 1880 how many temperature stations were there....where were they and what technology was in place....

CLEVELAND -- The first day of fall felt more like a summer one with a new record high set at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.

The mercury hit 89 degrees at 3:40 p.m. Thursday afternoon, setting aside the old record of 88 degrees in 1936.

Thursday marked the 99th day this year when the thermometer has been at least 80 degrees or better in the Greater Cleveland area.

Record high temperatures were also set in Mansfield with 90 degrees. Their old record was 90 in 1936.

Toledo's new record is 92 degrees after clipping the old record of 90 degrees in 1945.

Akron Canton and Youngstown both remained below their records on Thursday. Akron was 88 degrees. Youngstown was 86 degrees.

WKYC Meteorologist Betsy Kling says Friday will likely be another record setting day as well with temperatures again expected near 90. Friday's record high in Cleveland is 87 degrees set back in 1941.

The first full day of autumn still feels a lot like summer as daytime highs continue to soar into the mid- to upper 90s in the afternoon. And for the third straight day, Evansville tied or exceeded the record high temperature for the day.

The city recorded a temperature of 96 degrees, topping the 2007 record of 94 degrees. It comes a day after Evansville tied a 70-year-old record of 94 degrees on Wednesday, and two days after establishing a new record high for Sept. 21 at 98 degrees. The old record for Tuesday was 96 degrees, set in 1955.

Well, dimbulb, you really think that there is only one satellite taking temperatures? Many satellites from many nations. Your lies are getting more desperate, Walleyes.

The problem for you that would lie about what is being observed is that it is not just one nation, or one discipline, or even one group of scientists that are doing the observing of the warming temperatures, both land and sea. Rather, it is the whole of the scientific community, worldwide. So, you have either to invent a worldwide conspiracy of scientists from all nations and political systems, or you have to denigrate science.

You try to do both, but have failed in your attempts. The changing of the climate is just too obvious to the citizens of this planet.

Well I guess my "lies" are super duper effective then because the alarmists are in retreat all over the globe. Or maybe the things that I am stating are true and the people are tired of your religions prevarications. Fool them once shame on you, fool them twice shame on them, they are tired of your crap and your religion is suffering the consequences.

And to address your "point" I give you this... The bottom link shows how raw data has been "adjusted" to show a rise in temperature that doesn't exist. This is for Brisbane Australia....so yes it is a global problem with your high priests data. The public has finally figured it out and that is why you are losing, and rightfully so. Your side does not promote science, your side perverts it for financial gain. The public has figured it out and the public is pissed. You are losing and will shortly completely lose the entire thing. The money changers are leaving the "movement" only the true believers are still fighting the collapse and soon most of them will figure it out.

Summer 2010 is Central Park's hottest summer on record and one of Long Island's hottest, the National Weather Service said Monday.

According to data compiled from the National Weather Service's Islip recording station, 12 days this summer saw record-breaking high temperatures — five in June, four in July and two in August. However these records only represent the last 26 years — the National Weather Service began recording data at Islip's MacArthur Airport in 1984, while Central Park data dates back to 1869.

TOKYO —Japan is sweltering through its hottest summer on record, weather officials said Thursday.

The Asian country joins a large swath of the Northern Hemisphere that has experienced an unusually hot summer. Meteorologists say 17 nations have recorded all-time-high temperatures this year, more than in any other year, and scientists have said that July was the hottest month on record for the world's oceans.

A heat wave in Russia unprecedented in 130 years of record-keeping triggered thousands of wildfires, while a surge in temperatures across much of Europe caused crops to wither and roads to melt. In the U.S., many cities in the northeast had record summer heat, while earlier this month 18 states issued heat advisories.

In the Middle East, temperatures hit a record high in Kuwait during June, while those in Saudi Arabia were several degrees above average. In China, Shanghai had its hottest August on record, while other provinces broke decades-old records, according to domestic media reports.

It doesn’t take a weatherman to know that Southwest Florida swelters in the summer.

But just how hot was the summer of 2010?

Hotter than any other summer on record, according to an analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Average daytime — and nighttime — temperatures in June, July and August were the hottest ever recorded at two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather stations in Collier and Lee counties, the analysis shows.

The weather station at Page Field in Fort Myers, where data goes back to 1895, averaged 84.3 degrees during the day and 76.3 degrees at night.

The Everglades City airport weather station, where data goes back to 1927, averaged 84.63 degrees during the day and 77.17 degrees at night.

The hottest summer on record in Chattanooga ended Wednesday, but those looking for autumn relief from the heat will have to wait until at least Sunday.

WRCB-TV Meteorologist Paul Barys said high temperatures in Chattanooga are expected to remain in the 90s today, Friday and Saturday before cooling off with rain early next week.

“More normal fall temperatures won’t come until Sunday,” Barys said.

BY THE NUMBERS

* 83 — Average temperature in Chattanooga during June, July and August, or 5.2 degrees above normal.

* 7.91 — Inches of rain in Chattanooga during June, July and August, or 4.4 inches below normal.

* 111 — Peak heat index in degrees reached in Nashville on Aug. 4, when the actual temperatures averaged 100 degrees across the Tennessee Valley

* 34 — Number of days this summer on which the heat index in Memphis was at least 105 degrees

This week’s hotter-than-normal weather pushed the mercury on Tuesday to 97 degrees — just one degree shy of the all-time record — and is an extension of what was the warmest June, July and August in Chattanooga since the National Weather Service began keeping temperature records in 1879.

Increased tarmac???

In Central Park???

Ha, ha, ha, ha!!!!!

We have increased atmospheric CO2 by 40% in the last 200 years.

We have melted 40% of the North Polar ice cap in the last 50 years.

CO2 is now at its highest level ever recorded, and the Antarctic ice core record goes back 600,000 years.

We are adding 10 billion tons of CO2 to the atmosphere every year. In 100 years that will amount to 1,000 billion tons of additional CO2.

We are warming the earth, my friend.

PARIS — The first six months of 2010 brought a string of warmest-ever global temperatures, but connecting these dots to long-term climate change patterns remains frustratingly difficult, experts say.

Not only was last month the hottest June ever recorded, it was the fourth consecutive month in which the standing high mark was topped, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Indeed, 2010 has already surpassed 1998 for the most record-breaking months in a calendar year.

As a block, the January-to-June period registered the warmest combined global land and ocean surface temperatures since 1880, when reliable temperature readings began, NOAA said.

Arctic ice cover -- another critical yardstick of global warming -- had also retreated more than ever before by July 1, putting it on track to shrink beyond its smallest area to date, in 2007.

You posted links to this message board as proof and blog postings with no links.

Sorry, you really have nothing.

I would advise you to google "record temperatures" and see how many record cool tempertures you come up with compared to record hot temperatures.

now Chris, Try to understand, I am not even disputing that over all this summer has been hotter than normal in the Northern Hemisphere.

What I am doing this for is to point out to you and others. that you cherry pick stuff that supports your beliefs and ignore the stuff that does not.

These reports were not hard to find. Yet you just keep posting reports of High temps and never give us any context.

If you really want to be informed and know the truth. You can not do it by cherry picking the news that supports a belief you already hold. Stop typing Record High temps into google, and type Record Temps <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> Sure you will still find things have been hotter over all. But people might just give you more thought if you were not so Clearly trying to support one side while ignoring anything that does not jive with it.

Missouri, from your own link....

<a href="http://www.thorntonweather.com/blog/national-weather/noaa-summer-2009-was-34th-coolest-on-record-thousands-of-low-temp-records-set/">http://www.thorntonweather.com/blog/...p-records-set/</a>

Over the three month period, stations reporting to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) showed 2,254 daily record low temperatures and 1,296 low temperature records were tied according to preliminary data. Similarly, 4,051 daily record low maximums were recorded and 1,501 records were tied across the nation during the summer.

Almost two to one in favor of record low maximums. And this is from some right wing blog with no real links to the facts they are claiming.

Thanks for proving my point!

No, it has been the hottest summer on record.

Every El Nino year will get hotter and hotter as we melt the pole and increase atmospheric CO2.

The only reason the it hasn't been greater is that the Sun has been at its lowest level of activity in 80 years.

Just when you thought it was safe to turn off the air conditioner, Windsor was hit with more record-shattering heat overnight Thursday and into Friday.

"There must have been people tossing and turning in their sleep Friday morning because there has never been a morning as warm as that after Sept. 1," said Environment Canada climatologist David Phillips.

Friday broke the record for the highest low temperature of any date after Sept. 1, with the mercury failing to drop below 23.5 C.
"(Windsor) totally shattered the record Friday morning and it was brought to you by that warm southerly air," Phillips said.

He said the last time Windsor experienced a night that warm was when July 5 broke the same record with a nighttime temperature of 24.8.

"Windsor had all that cloud cover and 30.5 C on Thursday as a high and it got down to a chilly 23.5 C somewhere between 7-8 a.m. "It went up a little bit since then but that's a record of records."

Weather data is recorded back to 1940.

Amid extreme heat Sunday in Southern California, fire officials were preparing for the greater risk of blazes. The area experienced near-record temperatures on Saturday.

The Los Angeles Fire Department, as well as L.A. County and state firefighters, are staging in potential brush-fire danger zones so they can battle immediately any fires that break out. In addition to high temperatures Saturday, some parts of Southern California saw very low humidity.

According to the National Weather Service, Sunday and Monday should be hotter and drier than Saturday, when downtown Los Angeles recorded a high of 97 degrees and some inland valley areas exceeded 100 degrees.

I love how he talks about Science all the time. What he seems to fail to grasp. Is if he were really being scientific he would approach the issue as a skeptic. See when you approach it as a believer. You tend to look for evidence the reinforces what you already believe and ignore evidence which does not.

Any Scientist worth his salt will tell you, you must be a skeptic.

It's not only North America that is suffering one of the hottest summers on record (National Geographic News: 2010 to Be One of Hottest Years on Record). Russia has been enduring weeks of oppressive heat, now worsened by spontaneous peat and forest fires that are pumping smoke into the air.

While millions are gasping, hundreds of people trying to cool off have drowned--and Russia's crops are shriveling.

It’s Official: Hottest Summer on Record

With one final, fitting blast of 96-degree heat on Tuesday, the summer of 2010 went down in the National Weather Service’s record books as the hottest ever in New York City. Hotter than the previous high of 77.3 degrees set in 1966, when more than 1,100 deaths were attributed to heat that repeatedly exceeded 100 degrees. Hotter than 2006, when a heat wave set off a blackout in northern Queens in which more than 100,000 residents were without power for days.

Several cities across the Carolinas have posted record high temperatures to end the long hot summer.

The National Weather Service reported that Raleigh, N.C., had a high of 98 degrees Saturday — six degree more than the previous high set in 1986.

Florence, S.C., also saw its hottest Sept. 25 since 1986 with a temperature of 95 — one degree higher than the previous record.

In Charlotte, N.C., the high of 94 matched the previous record set in 1961. Greenville, S.C., also reported a high of 94 degrees beating the record of 93 set in 1933. Wilmington, N.C., hit 93 degrees, tying its 1986 record.

Western Australia endured its hottest summer on record, according to the state weather bureau.

At 29.6°C, temperatures were 0.2°C warmer than the previous record, set in 1997-1998. Western Australia has been keeping state-wide temperature data since 1950.

Perth, the state's capital, had its driest summer since record-keeping began in 1897. Only 0.2 millimeters of rain fell in between December and the end of February.

Japan endures hottest summer on record
(AP) – Sep 2, 2010

TOKYO — Japan is sweltering through its hottest summer on record, weather officials said Thursday.

The Asian country joins a large swath of the Northern Hemisphere that has experienced an unusually hot summer. Meteorologists say 17 nations have recorded all-time-high temperatures this year, more than in any other year, and scientists have said that July was the hottest month on record for the world's oceans.

A heat wave in Russia unprecedented in 130 years of record-keeping triggered thousands of wildfires, while a surge in temperatures across much of Europe caused crops to wither and roads to melt. In the U.S., many cities in the northeast had record summer heat, while earlier this month 18 states issued heat advisories.

In the Middle East, temperatures hit a record high in Kuwait during June, while those in Saudi Arabia were several degrees above average. In China, Shanghai had its hottest August on record, while other provinces broke decades-old records, according to domestic media reports.

Across Japan, temperatures soared higher than historical averages by 2.96 degrees Fahrenheit (1.64 degrees Celsius) from June through August, the highest since 1898 when records began, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

The hottest summer since records began 130 years ago and an accompanying drought sparked tens of thousands of fires in Russia. More than 50 people have died directly in the fires, and about 2,500 residences across Russia were destroyed.

The drought has cost the country a third of its wheat crop, prompting the government to ban wheat exports through the end of the year.

<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=global">State of the Climate | Global Analysis | August 2010</a>

The combined global land and ocean surface temperature during June–August 2010 was 16.2°C (61.3°F), which is 0.64°C (1.15°F) above the 20th century average of 15.6°C (60.1°F)—resulting in the second warmest June–August on record, behind 1998. Warmer-than-average temperatures were present across most of the world's land surface, with the warmest anomalies observed across eastern Europe, the eastern half of the contiguous U.S., and parts of eastern Canada, and eastern Asia. However, cooler-than-average conditions were present across parts of central Russia and southern South America. Overall, the worldwide land-only surface temperature ranked as the warmest on record, surpassing the previous record set in 1998 by 0.08°C (0.14°F). The June–August 2010 worldwide land-only surface temperature was 1.00°C (1.80°F) above the 20th century average of 13.8°C (56.9°F). Meanwhile, the worldwide ocean surface temperature was 0.51°C (0.92°F) above the 20th century average of 16.4°C (61.5°F), resulting in the fifth warmest such period on record. The Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific oceans had warmer-than-average conditions, while the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and along the North and South American Pacific coast, experienced cooler-than-average conditions associated with a developing La Niña.

The Inland area sizzled on Sunday and today will offer no relief from the record-breaking heat, the National Weather Service in San Diego said.

Riverside broke its previous record for the date by four degrees and is set to duplicate the feat on Monday, weather service meteorologist Mark Moede said.

Sunday's high temperature at Riverside Municipal Airport was 110, the new record for Sept. 26. The old record was 106, set last year.

Lake Elsinore also set a new record, hitting 106. The previous high was 104, set in 1963.

Both Ontario and Palm Springs tied their previous record highs, the weather service said. Ontatio International Airport hit 107, tying the mark set in 1978, while Palm Springs topped out at 111, matching the record set last year.

Palm Springs also set a record for highest minimum temperature. The mercury never dipped below 80 degrees there on Sunday.

Sunday’s high temperature of 104 degrees at Cal Poly broke the 1978 record of 102 degrees, according to local forecaster John Lindsey.

But that was the only record broken in San Luis Obispo County on Sunday despite the continuing heat added Lindsey, a communications specialist at Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

Paso Robles topped at 104 degrees, he said. The record of 107 degrees for that day was set last year, according to the National Weather Service.

What's not fake is that CO2 and other gases are known absorb infra-red radiation.

The concentrations of those gases, including some very potent ones not found in nature, have been going up since the advent of the Industrial Revoluiton, according to ice-core data.

Therefore, if the trend continues, warming is inevitable.

Your comment just shows your lack of knowledge off the topic, since it supports my thesis, not yours. On the one hand the amount of radiation water absorbs is irrelevant to the amount CO2 does. The bottom line is they both do and that fact does not disprove anything concerning my point. On the other hand, if CO2 raises temps even a little, more vapor would be able to enter the atmosphere and, since it IS a potent GHG, raise temps even further. Thus, CO2 can act as an amplifier. Whether the earth is a closed system or not is irrelevant.

The BORG hath spoken! If what you said were true the warming would allready be well advanced. It is not. If what you were saying were true the temperature of the Earth would have been much much higher in the past when the CO2 levels were 20 times higher than currently. They were not. The temps then were only 6 to 10 degrees warmer.
If what you were saying were true the RWP and the MWP would have been impossible without a major influx of CO2 but as we know that did not occur either.

All in all your theory is false. Your scientific methodology is terrible. And the world is going to go happily along as it is.

Closed system or open, makes no difference. Yes, that sure makes you rthe scientist, not. I see your not keeping track of the water vapor in the atmosphere. It aborbs MORE heat an CO2 idiot. Of course, it would be amusing to watch you make a case for humans being responsible for more wate vapor in the atmosphere. Faithers. It be funny, except for the stupid.

It is true that water vapor makes up the vast majority of the green house effect, but adding more co2 on top of it will cause a warming being that it also is a green house gas...200 million years earth had 1,200 PPM co2 and was 23c to todays 14c at 400 ppm...Also the sun was younger and had less output,,,the same today could cause a bit more kick. Kind of makes you wonder why the hell the last 10 million years has been so cold to earths avg with a brighter sun? The Question is why??? If we where to warm up to what we where 15 million years ago we would be getting closer to what is normal for earth, which you would say is the true temperature of our planet. The true temp or avg is not what we've made it and call it "0", but the trend over all earth's history when it is avg'ed.

Right??? I was looking at some charts from 0=today to around 600 million years ago and there is only like two periods as cold as it is now and they're now and 300-400 million years ago. So we're within a ice age so chances are that earth would want to move out of this ice age, so it could be a natural event, but helped by man some.

The summer of 2010 was bound to be remembered for cool temperatures across Los Angeles and a stubborn El Niño-enhanced marine layer blanketing the west side.

And then it became Fall.

The mercury hit an unprecedented 113 degrees shortly after noon and we may see hotter temps yet as the September sun bakes the downtown streets into the afternoon.

For the second Sunday in a row and the third time this month Denver has tied or broken a high temperature record. The Mile High City is on track to reach “top 10” status for the month for driest September's and possibly warmest.

At Denver International Airport today the high temperature reached 90 degrees at 2:54pm thus tying the record for the date set in 1892. This is far above the normal high temperature of 74 degrees for the date.

Denver also broke a high temperature record on Monday, September 20th when the mercury climbed to 94 degrees. This bested the old record for the date of 92 degrees set in 1956.

Last Sunday, September 19th, the mercury topped out an amazing 96 degrees. That broke the old record of 93 degrees set in 1980. It was also the hottest temperature ever recorded so late in the year and was the hottest Denver Broncos home game on record.

It is true that much of the world has been far above normal this year, but the west coast is not one of them... One record event don't change a cool summer. What is more important is seeing long periods of above avg temps...That is what forces the overall temps for a period of time up and you get your warming trends within area's from that. Not when you have one or two days of hot weather and go back to cooler then normal. That will be seen on the global maps come mid next month as a area of below normal.

Downtown LA is considered to be the Civic Center according to the article. The Civic Center has been in LA since about 1925. Also, note this, "The civic center has the distinction of containing the largest concentration of government employees in the United States outside of Washington, D. C. The reason is simple: Here are offices of the largest county in the country (Los Angeles) and the second largest city, along with several state and federal functions." In other words it is a giant heat sink of buildings.

God, you are lame...

The temperature reached 105 degrees today in El Cajon, breaking the previous record for Sept. 26th of 100 degrees, set in 1989. It also was 105 at the Ramona Airport, also breaking the previous record of 100 for the date. But that record was set in 2009.

It was 109 in Borrego Springs, one degree higher than the record for the date (set in 1991.) And it was 100 in Campo, breaking the record of 99 for the date, set in 2001.

Evening has brought little relief; at 7:45 p.m., it was still 87 in Poway and in La Mesa. (Live countywide temperature net)

Pretty warm, but quite stable with only a very slow warming. Most likely other factors like solar minimum and negative PDO, ect that is likely slowing or masking the full effects.

The heat is on - Denver easily shatters another high temperature record
September 28th, 2010 4:59 pm MT

The calendar may say late September and the seasons may have changed to fall but Mother Nature doesn't seem to have gotten the message. Denver has once again set a new record high temperature, the fourth time this month the Mile High City has done so.

At 3:55pm today the temperature at Denver International Airport reached 92 degrees. This eclipses the previous record high temperature for the date of 89 degrees set in 1994 and 1892.

This is the fourth time this month that we have tied or set a new record high temperature and September 2010 may very well end up as one of the top 10 warmest on record.

Reno experiences record Sept. 27 heat: 94 degrees
The Associated Press

Tuesday, Sept. 28, 2010 | 8:10 a.m.

Forecasters say record high temperatures are expected in the Reno and Sparks area for another couple of days.

The National Weather Service says the region saw an all-time high for the date on Monday, at 94 degrees.

The previous high for a Sept. 27 in Reno had been 93 degrees. That was last year.

Record and near-record highs are also expected Tuesday and Wednesday in Las Vegas, where temperatures on Monday hit 103 degrees at McCarran International Airport.

The Heat Keeps Coming For E. Idaho, W. WyomingThree Idaho Cities May Break Records Tuesday
By Idolina Walker, First Alert 8 Forecaster
September28, 2010

EASTERN IDAHO, WESTERN WYOMING -- Record high temperatures continue to be in jeopardy in our area Tuesday. Idaho Falls, Challis and Stanley stand to break previous records.

In Idaho Falls, a record high of 85 degrees was set in 1963. Tuesday's high is expected to be around 87 degrees, about 18 degrees higher than average for Sept. 28. On Monday, the city was 1 degree shy of matching their high of 86 set back in 1969.

Pocatello was also a few degrees shy of breaking their record for Monday. However on Tuesday, they could tie the 1994 record with an expected daytime high of 90 degrees, 20 degrees higher than normal.

From Los Angeles to San Francisco to Sacramento, the temperatures were scorching on Monday -- a hot pattern that was expected to continue today.

The high on Monday was a record-setting 113 in Los Angeles, 93 in San Francisco and 99 in Sacramento.

Those kind of temperatures will repeat today in many spots as a strong high pressure system remains in place. Record or near record temperatures are predicted by the National Weather Service:

-- Redding, 103 record, 101 the forecast high.

-- Red Bluff, 102 record, 102 forecast high.

-- Downtown Sacramento, 100 record, 101 forecast high.

-- Sacramento Executive Airport, 100 record, 101 forecast high.

-- Stockton, 100 record, 102 forecast high.

-- Modesto, 100 record, 100 forecast high.

The mercury soared to 104 in Santa Rosa for the second straight day on Tuesday, once again setting a record.

Tuesday’s scorcher broke the record of 102 set in 1921, and came in a whopping 23 degrees above the 30-year average temperature of 81 for Sept. 28.

Other hot spots in the region were Cloverdale at 106, Windsor 105, Calistoga and Ukiah 103, Healdsburg, Sonoma, Sebastopol and Middletown at 101 and Cazadero at 100.

Todays data for Portland

TEMPERATURE (F)
TODAY
MAXIMUM 77 206 PM, Avg high 71
MINIMUM 63 413 AM, Avg low 50
AVERAGE 70, Avg means 60

So overall today had 10 degree's above normal...That then make this month from perfectly normal to slightly above normal. Portland will likely get a small red circle on the climate map in a few weeks.

I think it is funny that edthecynic is all hot and bothered by two of the few climate scientists that are able to admit to previous mistakes and correct their thinking to incorporate new and conflicting data.

Actually, they claimed their adjustments to the raw satellite data were the most accurate on Earth when their data contradicted all the other data. Other scientists had to correct their errors for them. Only after their errors were proven by others did they grudgingly admit their data was not accurate and only because they could no longer deny it.

Now that they can no longer fudge the satellite data, suddenly they claim that all satellite data is no good any more.

Please link an article or study that support your version of the satellite debate over adjustments and correlation to land based temperatures. So I can destroy it.

SALT LAKE CITY — There were nine high temperature records set in Utah on Tuesday and another tied as the unusually hot weather spell continues.

Salt Lake City climbed to 90 degrees Tuesday, one tick shy of tying the record for the date. A high of at least 86 degrees was expected at the Salt Lake International Airport Wednesday and that is predicted to climb to 89 degrees on Friday, before the daytime highs finally begin to cool off.

Normal high temperature for this time of year is 72 degrees.

When the temperature in Santa Maria hit 105 Monday afternoon, it not only surpassed the century mark, it broke a nearly 100-year-old record.

The previous high for Sept. 27 was 99 degrees set in 1917.

Santa Maria wasn’t alone in setting records. Downtown Los Angeles reached 113 degrees just before noon, breaking a 47-year-old mark.

Santa Barbara hit 100 degrees, surpassing the 99 degrees set in 1970.

Vandenberg Air Force Base peaked at 104 degrees and San Luis Obispo reached 106. Lompoc was a relatively balmy 97 degrees.

Yes, I understand the basics. What I am wondering is where the temp readings were made, at the local airport (a perennial favourite), the downtown civic center (another old favourite) in other words they tend to take the temps from wherever it is hottest and ignore the others. If you bother to do a little looking you would find that the record heat that was reported in the eastern seaboard came from two airport locations that both read 105 degrees. All the other stations were reading much less.

This is the nws being the offical weather service they should have high standards for all temperature data. I agree that all temperature stations should be away from pavement within a grass area away from buildings. I hope they fix this soon.

</quote>

Until they do, nothing they produce is accurate, thus not usable. All of NOAA's data sets are suspect. Look up surfacestations.org from soem pretty amusing locations for weather stations, there are more than one sited at an airport where jet exhaust hits them dead on.
Also look up satellitegate for a interesting report on the false readings that have been accumulated for the last 10 years. And NOAA knew about the problem! 15 degree errors (on the hot side of course) were not uncommon, in fact there were readings of 600 degrees(!) in the arctic! Until they get rid of the politically motivated directors they are simply not trustworthy.

Reno heat breaks record for third day
September 29, 2010 4:28pm PDT

The heat in Reno broke the record high temperatures Wednesday for the third day in a row.

As of 3 p.m., the temperature in Reno was 94 degrees. The old record for this date was 91 degrees set back in 1963. Tomorrow's forecast high will be 94, with the record being 92 set back in 1980.

TUCSON - Record or near record highs are possible Wednesday and Thursday, says News 4 Tucson Meteorologist Chris Nallan.

A strong high pressure aloft is heating up Southern Arizona. A stubborn upper level low pressure is bringing clouds and a few showers to western section of Arizona Wednesday. I expect plenty of sunshine from Central Pima to Cochise Counties Wednesday afternoon.

September 2010 could go down as the second hottest on record. Tucson could tie that record Thursday that was set in 1956.

Phoenix area temperatures are expected to reach 107 degrees Thursday, which would tie the all-time record set in 1980, according to the National Weather Service.

Wednesday's high temperatures came in slightly below the expected high of 107 degrees, reaching 104.

Temperatures through Friday are expected to be within a few degrees of reaching record highs, with a high of 107 on Thursday, 105 on Friday and 103 on Saturday.

Note road in foreground within 10 meters.

Official temperatures for the City of Phoenix that are mentioned on local news and radio weather reports are obtained from the National Weather Service in Phoenix, AZ. The ASOS (Automated Surface Observation System), pictured here, is the system used to determine the official readings for the temperature in Phoenix.

Why is the temperature mentioned on the news different than what my outdoor thermometer reads?
Greater Phoenix covers a large area. Your location may be at a higher elevation or have more surrounding vegetation, for example. Official readings in Phoenix may be as much as five or ten degrees different than other parts of the Valley of the Sun.

Triple-digit temperatures hit Malibu
Published:
Wednesday, September 29, 2010 11:22 AM PDT
Temperatures were as high as 110 in the mountains of Malibu.

By Jonathan Friedman / The Malibu Times

As was the case for the rest of Los Angeles County, there was a major temperature spike in Malibu on Monday. The National Weather Service reported it reached 103 degrees at 2 p.m., according to a measurement point in Malibu Park. That was relatively cool compared to more elevated areas just outside Malibu, where the temperature went above 110.

Russia has recently seen the longest unprecedented heat wave for at least one thousand years, the head of the Russian Meteorological Center said on Monday.

Wildfires continue to rage across much of the central part of European Russia as the country experiences a heat wave, with temperatures of up to and above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).

"We have an 'archive' of abnormal weather situations stretching over a thousand years. It is possible to say there was nothing similar to this on the territory of Russia during the last one thousand years in regard to the heat," Alexander Frolov said.

Several Carolinas cities post record high temperatures to end long, hot summer
The Associated Press
11:27 AM EDT, September 26, 2010

Several cities across the Carolinas have posted record high temperatures to end the long hot summer.

The National Weather Service reported that Raleigh, N.C., had a high of 98 degrees Saturday — six degree more than the previous high set in 1986.

Florence, S.C., also saw its hottest Sept. 25 since 1986 with a temperature of 95 — one degree higher than the previous record.

In Charlotte, N.C., the high of 94 matched the previous record set in 1961. Greenville, S.C., also reported a high of 94 degrees beating the record of 93 set in 1933. Wilmington, N.C., hit 93 degrees, tying its 1986 record.

The Weather Service says Columbia and Florence in South Carolina and Lumberton and Fayetteville in North Carolina had more than 100 days with temperatures of 90 degrees or more this year.

The Japan Meteorological Agency announced that 2010 average summer temperatures across the country were the hottest on their over 100 year long record.

According to a September 1st JMA press release, the average temperature during the three month period of June to August was 1.64°C higher than a 30-year average for the same period. While June and July were hotter than normal, at +1.24°C and +1.42°C respectively, August temperatures pushed the record to the top of the books with an average of +2.25°C. Tracking began in 1898; the previous hottest summer was in 1994, when temperatures were 1.36°C above the average.

Australia is a first world country that takes their science seriously and has been out in front of the curve on many global problems. Yet they still have problems with quality control when it comes to data collection for temperature readings and the adjustments made to the data.

<a href="http://joannenova.com.au/2010/07/australian-warming-trend-adjusted-up-by-40/">Australian warming trend adjusted UP by 40% « JoNova</a>

<quote>
This study shows a number of problems with the Australian High Quality Temperature Sites network, on which the official temperature analyses are based. Problems with the High Quality data include:

It has been subjectively and manually adjusted.
The methodology used is not uniformly followed, or else is not as described.
Urban sites, sites with poor comparative data, and sites with short records have been included.
Large quantities of data are not available, and have been filled in with estimates.
The adjustments are not equally positive and negative, and have produced a major impact on the Australian temperature record.
The adjustments produce a trend in mean temperatures that is roughly a quarter of a degree Celsius greater than the raw data does.
The warming bias in the temperature trend is 40%, and in the anomaly trend is 50%.

</quote>

and here is a quote that really makes you wonder how low some people will stoop to add bogus readings into the mix and call it 'High Quality Rural Data'

<quote>
There is site called Bourke Airport in New South Wales – it’s listed as a Rural Site as it is out of town and is therefore included in the national temperature analysis.

Yet Bourke Airport was established in 1999 and has only 9 years of data! So where did the data from 1910 – 1999 come from? Well it matches perfectly with Brewarrina Hospital 80kms away in the heart of Brewarrina that has a record back to 1910 – well it’s not an exact match because the earlier years have been systematically adjusted downwards along with the typical rural town UHI influence yet it’s included as Rural!

The same technique has been used for Glenn Innes airport which was established in 1997 yet by using the Glenn Innes Post Office data with it’s typical UHI ( increasing min temp) they have a record going back to 1910 yet it’s also classified as Rural.

In total record high nighttime temperatures occurred in: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

It is because concrete and asphalt are too close to the weather stations Chris. I think we have demonstrated that pretty clearly here. Bad data that needs correcting falls right into the hands of scientists bent on continuing their funding by faking data further.

And who has been putting all the asphalt and concrete next to the glaciers in Glacier National Park?

And your denigration scientists and accusations of fraud on thier part is duly noted. Holy Roller preachers and Southern politicians are so much more trustworthy.

You are an idiot.

The only people who resemble religious extremists are you and yours olfraud. Only climatologists are qualified to render opinions on climate science (your high priests)

Russia’s record heat wave may already have taken 15,000 lives and cost the economy $15 billion as fires and drought ravage the country.

At least 7,000 people have probably died in Moscow as a result of the heat, and the nationwide death toll is likely to be at least twice that figure, according to Jeff Masters, co- founder of Weather Underground, a 15-year-old Internet weather service that gathers information from around the world.

“The Russian population affected by extreme heat is at least double the population of Moscow, and the death toll in Russia from the 2010 heat wave is probably at least 15,000, and may be much higher,” Masters said late yesterday on his blog.

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took to the air today to douse a forest fire south of Moscow. The heat wave may slice 1 percent off of Russia’s $1.5 trillion economy this year because of lower agricultural output and reduced activity in other areas such as industry, Alexander Morozov, chief economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Moscow, said in an e-mail today.

Russia may harvest a third less grain than last year because of drought, Putin said yesterday. Companies such as automaker OAO AvtoVAZ have curbed production, and restaurants in Moscow are seeing a decline in customers as residents avoid smoke from wildfires that is blanketing the city.

West Palm Beach sweated through its hottest September on record, as the city reached an average temperature of 84.3 degrees, the National Weather Service in Miami said Thursday. That broke the previous record of 83.3 degrees set in 1951.

Fort Lauderdale saw an average September temperature of 83.2 degrees, shy of that city's record of 84.5, set in 2008. Miami reached 83.5 degrees, while the record is 84.02, set in 1974 and 1989.

West Palm Beach's heat record comes after it experienced its warmest three-month period of June, July and August, as did Fort Lauderdale and Miami. The weather service said persistent high pressure generated all the heat.

TUCSON - Expect an abnormally hot last day of September, says News 4 Meteorologist Chris Nallan.

Temperatures will rise into the 100s this afternoon across the Tucson Metro. We are set to break a record this afternoon which will mark this September in the record books. Tucson set a record back on this day in 1989 of 101. The forecast high today is 103 which will shatter that previous record. Today will be our 16th day this month at 100 or better, which will automatically bring us to the second hottest September on record.

In the US 72,000 deaths every year are attributed to cold weather. Cold causes blood to thicken and also compromises peoples immune systems thus making them vulnerable to pulmonary illnesses. The same holds true for Europe. It has nothing to do with the level of technology or government, it has to do with the simple fact that cold weather is far more
punishing to the body than warm weather is.

And warm weather has the advantage that you can use air conditioning to help mitigate the effects of the heat. For some reason the use of heaters on cold does not seem to have the same beneficial effect as the use of AC does on heat.

With three days left in September, the month is shaping up to be one of the hottest and driest on record for Boulder.

Matt Kelsch, a meteorologist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, said Boulder's high temperatures for September, so far, are averaging 84.2 degrees -- about 7 degrees above average.

"It's been a warm, dry August and September," he said.

Depending on how hot it gets on Tuesday, he said, Boulder has a chance to beat the second-highest average September temperature -- 84.5 degrees -- set in 1956.

Boulder also could break the record high temperature for Sept. 28 of 89 degrees. Tuesday's forecast calls for highs in the low 90s.

Salinas Valley cities saw some of their hottest days on record today as a heat wave swept the state.

At the Salinas airport, National Weather Service forecaster Bob Benjamin said the thermometer hit 102 degrees, breaking this day's 1970 record of 101 by one degree.

But near South Main Street in Salinas, the temperature was one degree shy of a 1970 record of 102 degrees. The temperatures more than doubled from last night's low, recorded at 46 degrees.

As for the beach city of Santa Cruz, the temperature there reached 103 degrees, tying its 1970 record.

All those nice little airports giving high readings. No wonder those are the weather stations of choice for those who wish to inflate the temp data. Salinas' airport had major work done in 1999 that added over 1000 feet of nice cement aprons to the airport and encroached on the weather station even further. Santa Cruz had major work done all over the place following the Loma Prieta earthquake back in 1989, I have no idea how much more cement and asphalt were laid down but it was significant.

In other words yet another epic fail for those who would supposedly tell us what the real temperatures are. But the religious fanatics will ignore that.

Average temperatures recorded in Canada’s north this past summer are among the highest recorded in 63 years of data collection, according to preliminary figures released by Environment Canada.

Temperatures in northern B.C. and the Yukon were slightly less than one degree Celsius above the recorded average, but the warming trend was more pronounced in the most northerly regions.

The arctic mountains and fiords were 1.9C above average, the hottest summer on record. Summer in Mackenzie region, which encompasses much of the Northwest Territories, was the third hottest on record. Six of the past ten summers in the arctic tundra region have been ranked in the top ten hottest summers recorded.

Here is a look at some of the record-breaking temperatures from across the globe:

1. A record high in Los Angeles
For the first time ever, downtown L.A. registered at 113 degrees on Monday, besting the previous mark of 112 set in 1990.

2. Houston's hottest month ever
While Houston's residents are used to hot days, they've never seen heat like this, with an average temperature of 87.8 degrees in August, a new record for the hottest month in the city's history.

3. A new all-time high in Asia
Temperatures in Pakistan's ancient city of Mohenjo-daro reached a scorching 129 degrees on June 1, marking the hottest weather ever recorded in Asia, and the fourth-highest temperature in history.

4. An unprecedented heat wave in Russia
With smoke from burning peat-bogs clogging the muggy air, the heat in Moscow on August 6 broke the "psychological barrier" of 40 degrees Celsius, or 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

5. Record heat in Sudan
While searing weather is common in Sudan, the 121-degree temperature recorded on June 25 in the city of Dongola was the hottest the country has ever seen. The previous record was set in 1987.

6. New all-time highs in the Middle East
U.S. troops in Iraq endured some of the most intense heat of the summer. The mercury hit a blistering 125.6 degrees Fahrenheit in July, the highest temperature ever recorded in the country.

7. The hottest month in world history — four times in a row
June 2010 was the warmest month ever recorded on planet Earth. The previous mark had been set in May. The mark before that had been set in April. The one before that in March. Sense a trend?

Just note that in almost every case he has presented thus far, I have found significant problems with the weather station.

Well I wonder how many other weather satellites there are? The Europeans have one METEOSAT-8 (originally called MSG-1 and lo and behold it has a few problems) the EU is planning on launching a bunch of new satellites beginning in 2015 however.

"MSG is capable of full-disk images every 15 minutes. With a 60-cm aperture and a ton of spin-stabilized mass, imagery is sharp and stable.

Bandwidth limitations allow it to only downlink half of the 1 km resolution visible data (the left, middle, or right portion of the full-width scan). Their notion of data compression is to throw away half the image.

MSG-1 was originally scheduled to launch in October 2000, but was delayed until July 2001 to deal with issues with the launch (moving from a dedicated launch on Ariane-4 to a rougher, shared launch on Ariane-5) and the ground segment. Further concerns about the ground system readiness delayed the launch schedule to August 2002. The MSG-1 satellite was successfully launched on 28 August 2002, and turned over to EUMETSAT on 25 September. First public imagery was due in late October 2002.

However, on 17 October 2002, a power supply switched off unexpectedly. Since then, the three remaining power supplies are being babied, preventing the global rebroadcast of the full resolution imagery, which will have to be routed through commercial communications satellites. As of November 2003, SEVERI HRIT and LRIT data is transmitted via EUMETCast, a satellite DVB broadcast system that provides coverage over Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of eastern North and South America."

The Russians launched their first of a series of five planned weather satellites in September of 2009 and the last word is it is still in the calibration stage (I would hope that that has been completed by now but there has been no update yet) it is known as the Meteor-M-1

The Japanese have the GOES-9 satellite but guess what? IT'S OPERATED BY NOAA! And it is one of those reading poorly.

The Indians have INSAT and guess what? Well I'll just cut and paste for you!

"In the mid-1990's, INSAT imagery was encrypted to hide it from the surrounding nations, leaving a major gap in real time global cloud coverage. An agreement was signed in late 1997 by NASA, NOAA, and the Indian government for western access to real time INSAT data, and data began flowing by mid-1999.
These publicly available INSAT images are at least 3 days old, in accordance with the agreement with India not to distribute real time INSAT data. Even then, these images are restricted to use by the employees of NASA and NOAA, and to their contract employees, including univerities engaged in NASA-funded or NOAA-funded research."

Canada has the PCW satellite controlled by you guessed it NOAA.

The Chinese have the Feng Yung 2 satellite and guess what? Yep controlled by NASA and NOAA.

Below is a request from the dirrector of information control Jim Dodge.

It would also help if you would give me a brief description of the
research that your are planning to do with the data. While we have heard
of the desires to study the diurnal variabilities of various cloud regimes,
and the interactions among atmospheric layers, as well as the evolution
of large-scale storm systems, we are also interested to learn of the many
possible atmospheric radiation interpretations, boundary layer-ocean
interactions, multiple satellite analyses, latent heat exchange estimations,
wind-wave relationships, rainfall estimation, and possible bioproductivity
implications.

Thanks for helping us to provide an efficient data access and
delivery system for what promises to be a great new source of
environmental satellite data.

TUCSON - Summer refuses to call it quits on the first day of October.

According to News 4 Meteorologist Jeff Beamish, the Tucson International Airport hit 102 degrees today. That eclipsed the record high of 101 degrees set on this date in 1955.

In addition, the 102 degree high in Tucson today tied the all-time record high temperature for the month of October. The last time Tucson hit 102 degrees in October was on October 3rd, 1993.

I see. Then all the weather satellites that the various nations have in orbit are part of the nefarious plot to confuse poor little people like you.

</quote>

Well I wonder how many other weather satellites there are? The Europeans have one METEOSAT-8 (originally called MSG-1 and lo and behold it has a few problems) the EU is planning on launching a bunch of new satellites beginning in 2015 however.

"MSG is capable of full-disk images every 15 minutes. With a 60-cm aperture and a ton of spin-stabilized mass, imagery is sharp and stable.

Bandwidth limitations allow it to only downlink half of the 1 km resolution visible data (the left, middle, or right portion of the full-width scan). Their notion of data compression is to throw away half the image.

MSG-1 was originally scheduled to launch in October 2000, but was delayed until July 2001 to deal with issues with the launch (moving from a dedicated launch on Ariane-4 to a rougher, shared launch on Ariane-5) and the ground segment. Further concerns about the ground system readiness delayed the launch schedule to August 2002. The MSG-1 satellite was successfully launched on 28 August 2002, and turned over to EUMETSAT on 25 September. First public imagery was due in late October 2002.

However, on 17 October 2002, a power supply switched off unexpectedly. Since then, the three remaining power supplies are being babied, preventing the global rebroadcast of the full resolution imagery, which will have to be routed through commercial communications satellites. As of November 2003, SEVERI HRIT and LRIT data is transmitted via EUMETCast, a satellite DVB broadcast system that provides coverage over Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of eastern North and South America."

The Russians launched their first of a series of five planned weather satellites in September of 2009 and the last word is it is still in the calibration stage (I would hope that that has been completed by now but there has been no update yet) it is known as the Meteor-M-1

The Japanese have the GOES-9 satellite but guess what? IT'S OPERATED BY NOAA! And it is one of those reading poorly.

The Indians have INSAT and guess what? Well I'll just cut and paste for you!

"In the mid-1990's, INSAT imagery was encrypted to hide it from the surrounding nations, leaving a major gap in real time global cloud coverage. An agreement was signed in late 1997 by NASA, NOAA, and the Indian government for western access to real time INSAT data, and data began flowing by mid-1999.
These publicly available INSAT images are at least 3 days old, in accordance with the agreement with India not to distribute real time INSAT data. Even then, these images are restricted to use by the employees of NASA and NOAA, and to their contract employees, including univerities engaged in NASA-funded or NOAA-funded research."

Canada has the PCW satellite controlled by you guessed it NOAA.

The Chinese have the Feng Yung 2 satellite and guess what? Yep controlled by NASA and NOAA.

Below is a request from the dirrector of information control Jim Dodge.

It would also help if you would give me a brief description of the
research that your are planning to do with the data. While we have heard
of the desires to study the diurnal variabilities of various cloud regimes,
and the interactions among atmospheric layers, as well as the evolution
of large-scale storm systems, we are also interested to learn of the many
possible atmospheric radiation interpretations, boundary layer-ocean
interactions, multiple satellite analyses, latent heat exchange estimations,
wind-wave relationships, rainfall estimation, and possible bioproductivity
implications.

Thanks for helping us to provide an efficient data access and
delivery system for what promises to be a great new source of
environmental satellite data.

So what was that olfraud? Seems to me even the foreign satellites are controlled by NASA/NOAA.

Now if NASA controlled this satellite, why would they be requesting permission to recieve and share the data?

If anyone else goes to the site given, you will readily see that NASA does not control the satellites of other nations. That there are agreements by which nations that have not launched the various satellites share data, and have stations of their own to recieve that data.

Why the purposeful lies, Walleyes? For that is what the statement that NASA controls the information from the satellites of foriegn nations is.

<a href="http://goes.gsfc.nasa.gov/text/geonews.html#FENGYUN2">GEO-NEWS AROUND THE WORLD</a>

NASA requested and obtained permission to receive and share FY-2 data. This satellite will provide much needed coverage of the central Asian Hemisphere on an hourly basis. NASA has arranged to receive the data in Adelaide, Australia at the University of Southern Australia, and to transmit some full-resolution data, as well as calculated real-time products and localized sectors, over the Internet through Hawaii to NASA's Ames Research Center and Goddard Space Flight Center. There, the data will join similar data already being provided for GOES-8/9 and GMS-5. The data will be a short-term archive of infrared-resolution images, on-line for perhaps a week. Long-term archiving of the data will be performed by anyone willing to download the images using anonymous FTP from the NASA sites.

Subject: Real-Time FY-2 Data

Dear Colleagues:

Many of you have expressed an interest in receiving geostationary
meteorological satellite data over the Asian Hemisphere. As you know the
Chinese have recently launched a successful geostationary satellite and
placed it at 105 deg E. Highly-compressed samples of their three channels
(VIS, IR, and WV) are provided as attachments to this e-mail. Direct
broadcast of the FY-2 data will begin in Oct., 1997. NASA has located a
ground station for direct reception of the data at the Univ. of Southern
Australia in Adelaide. The antenna has been erected, and the receiver,
built in Hawaii and tested on GMS, will be installed before reception begins.

Since any geostationary satellite produces large volumes of data, and
FY-2, with its three bands, and hourly observations is no exception, we plan
to place a computer at the reception site to generate segmented or
subsampled files for reduced-volume transmission of the key data sets
for real-time projects. We ask that you consider your real-time data
requests carefully and plan a regular downloading of the requested products
before their residence on the temporary storage site expires. Currently,
we are planning a two-week residence time for the data. The data will be
mirrored through Ames Research Center, and the Goddard Space Flight
Center.

We ask that you submit your requests for various areas and/or
formats of real-time data so that we may attempt to consolidate the
requests into reasonable sets of data that may satisfy the needs of
several users and thereby save storage space and processing time.

West Palm Beach sweated through its hottest September on record, as the city reached an average temperature of 84.3 degrees, the National Weather Service in Miami said Thursday. That broke the previous record of 83.3 degrees set in 1951.

Fort Lauderdale saw an average September temperature of 83.2 degrees, shy of that city's record of 84.5, set in 2008. Miami reached 83.5 degrees, while the record is 84.02, set in 1974 and 1989.

West Palm Beach's heat record comes after it experienced its warmest three-month period of June, July and August, as did Fort Lauderdale and Miami. The weather service said persistent high pressure generated all the heat.

Last month was the hottest September on record for Colorado Springs, and La Niña, the Pacific Ocean climatic phenomenon blamed for the heat wave, is predicted to continue through the fall and winter, said Mark Wankowski, meterologist with the National Weather Service in Pueblo.

Last month’s average temperature was a whopping 7.2 degrees warmer than the long-term September average of 59.8 degrees and 0.4 degrees warmer than the previous record average temperature for September of 66.6 degrees, set in 1931.

The Sun just went through its lowest level of activity in 80 years, so I knew last winter was going to be a little colder than what we have seen lately. Then El Nino came along and those are always the hottest years, and with the influence of CO2...the hottest ever.

This winter won't be as cold as the last, since the Sun's activity is moving up and the influence of atmospheric CO2 grows greater every day.

True, but the earth is now in a strong la nina like 1999, 2008 right now and that should make this year second or third, which is pretty good when you think of all the negative effects that where not around in 1998, 2005 that are around now. 1# Biggest solar minimum in 80-100 years 2# Negative PDO. The negative pdo could be the reason for the slight reverse in the downward trend in arctic sea ice.

In the solar max so far as been the weakest in at least as long and I believe the effects compound on their selfs, so a cooling effect likely is still being seen. Making it even more amazing.

There is no question in my mind that if this fucking la nina would of stayed weak instead of going strong 2010 would of blown 2005 and 1998 out of the fucking water.

The summer of 2010, among the hottest on record, warmed up Long Island Sound enough to create life-threatening conditions to marine life, state environmental officials say.

Specifically, according to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, a lack of dissolved oxygen for bottom-dwellers such as lobsters, fluke, clams, young sea robins, menhaden and cunner – a condition known as "hypoxia" – effectively suffocated those species.

"If we do continue to get this increase in temperatures, we may get a shift in the species of the Long Island Sound," Matthew Lyman, an environmental analyst with the DEP, told Patch.

According to Joe Pollina, a meteorologist at the Upton, N.Y.-based National Weather Service, which runs an observation site in Bridgeport, 2010 was "the warmest summer on record" since 1948, with average temperatures of 75 degrees.

Portugal has just emerged from the second hottest summer on record, the Portuguese Met Office revealed this week.

Following on news that July had been the hottest since 1931, it was revealed this week that the summer of 2010, taking into account the months of June, July and August, was the hottest for 79 years.

This past summer, according to the Met Office, witnessed average temperatures of 23ºC on mainland Portugal which is 1.7ºC above the average for the reference period, which is 1971 to 2000. Average maximum temperatures this past summer were 30ºC, which is a staggering 2.5ºC above what the Met Office considers normal, while thermometers sat at an average minimum of 15.9ºC, which is 1ºC above what weathermen would expect for that time of the year.

Single day record highs doesn't equate to rising global temperatures. So far this year alone we have found out the following:

The ice caps are melting at half the rate science reported.
A majority of weather stations are near heat sources.
Satellite and station data are basically a monopoly of a few scientists who immediately "correct" the data.

Party is over and with the economy as is, funding will dry up soon.

Chris has no "facts" in the true sense of the meaning. He has "truthiness" facts. Look it up you'll laugh.

And you have nothing but personal attacks.

How sad.

You are nothing but a personal attack.. Your whole methodology is designed to make people angry at you so that they will lose control and lash out at you. Thus making them look foolish. So sad for you that intelligent people see through your juvenile tactics and call out your inane behaviour.

You present fraudulent data and think that you can convince people that you are correct. What planet exactly has that ever worked on for you? You are the one who has a zero rep, how exactly did you get that? Shenanigans on a grand scale no doubt. You expect people to actually grant you any sort of respectability or creedence? Really?

How is that working for you? What sort of job at Goldman Sachs do you have that allows you to eat? You have ZERO credibility. So feel free to post your silly false facts and people like me and Saveliberty and Ianc will continue to play WHACK-A-MOLE until you finally stay down in your hole.

I understand what Chris is trying to show with his posts. He is saying there are huge numbers of highs being reported and that is telling for an increase in global temperatures. What he refuses to acknowledge is, these weather stations are going to report abnormally high temps because of increased concrete and other heat sources being placed near the equipment. In many cases the readings are 4-10 degrees higher than other personal stations near the sites. That is enough in most cases to actually translate into a decrease in temperatures below normal. It would be nice if Chris could admit this is happening on a fairly large scale.

Most of the 1,000 weather stations reporting record highs are in rural areas.

I hope so because I love wild weather, but I seriously doubt it and believe strongly that this is a bunch of hype. How many times does these hypers have to talk about a new ice age...Sure we should be cooling based on natural effects, but we aren't... The why to whats stopping a new cooling is why we're debating back and forth about.

Brrrr! Low temperature records set in Oklahoma

Associated Press - October 4, 2010 6:15 PM ET

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Overnight temperatures broke records in parts of Oklahoma, including one that dated back to the 19th century.

The National Weather Service reported Monday the morning low temperature at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City reached 37 degrees, breaking the previous record for Oct. 4 of 40 degrees set in 1891.

The weather service says the low temperature in Tulsa also reached 37 degrees overnight, breaking a record of 39 degrees set on Oct. 4, 1987.

According to the Oklahoma Mesonet, low temperatures ranged from 29 degrees in Oilton near Tulsa to 49 degrees in Kenton in the Oklahoma Panhandle.

So says the pot. The difference between you and I is I don't lie. If I make a mistake I own up to it. You on the other hand live a lie. You claim to be an environmentalist yet work in a polluting industry for a notoriously polluting company.

You are correct it is weather. So are the "record" temps that Chris posts ad nauseum about. The difference is the cold records are real.....you can't hide blizzards that kill hundreds of thousands of animals nearly as easily as you can fudge a temperature record up a few ticks to give you a record high reading.

If you think summer has never been this hot, you’re quite right. What you’re experiencing could well be the hottest summer in 100 years. The first four months of 2010 have been the hottest on record and north India hasn’t been this warm in 100 years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) — America’s climate agency, which monitor global weather using satellites — said on Tuesday. If this trend continues, 2010 could be the warmest in history.

“March has been recorded as the warmest month in the last 60 years in north India,” said the NOAA report. Average global temperature in January-April was 13.3 degree Celsius, 0.69 degrees above the average recorded since 1880.

Three regions in the world — Canada, North Africa and South Asia — recorded average temperatures higher than the rest of the world.

I see. A huge conspiracy involving the scientists and space agencies in the US, Europe, China, and Japan. And all the people recording the temperatures on all the inhabited continents. Been fitted for a tinfoil hat lately?

Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate.
<a href="http://geology.com/nasa/antarctic-ice-sheet-melting.shtml">Antarctic Ice Sheet Melting Speeds Up</a>

Ice loss in Antarctica increased by 75 percent in the last 10 years due to a speed-up in the flow of its glaciers and is now nearly as great as that observed in Greenland, according to a new, comprehensive study by NASA and university scientists.

In a first-of-its-kind study, an international team led by Eric Rignot of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and the University of California, Irvine, estimated changes in Antarctica's ice mass between 1996 and 2006 and mapped patterns of ice loss on a glacier-by-glacier basis. They detected a sharp jump in Antarctica's ice loss, from enough ice to raise global sea level by 0.3 millimeters (.01 inches) a year in 1996, to 0.5 millimeters (.02 inches) a year in 2006.

Rignot said the losses, which were primarily concentrated in West Antarctica's Pine Island Bay sector and the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, are caused by ongoing and past acceleration of glaciers into the sea. This is mostly a result of warmer ocean waters, which bathe the buttressing floating sections of glaciers, causing them to thin or collapse. "Changes in Antarctic glacier flow are having a significant, if not dominant, impact on the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet," he said.

And then there is the accelerating sea level rise

<a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/gornitz_01/">NASA GISS: Science Briefs: Sea Level Rise</a>

Sea level could rise 40 to 65 cm by the year 2100, due to predicted greenhouse-gas-induced climate warming. Such a sea level rise would threaten coastal cities, ports, and wetlands with more frequent flooding, enhanced beach erosion, and saltwater encroachment into coastal streams and aquifers. Therefore, it is important to study records of how sea level has been changing.

Sea level has fluctuated dramatically in geologic times. It was 2-6 m above the present level during the last interglacial period, 125,000 years ago, but 120 m below present during the last Ice Age, 20,000 years ago. In the last 100 years it has increased by 10-25 cm. However, future sea level is very difficult to predict, because not enough is known about how the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica will react to global warming. Furthermore, local sea level is affected by many regional processes, including tides, ocean currents, and geographically-varying land movements. These Earth motions are caused by ongoing adjustments of Earth's crust to the removal of the former ice sheets, tectonic deformation, subsidence of river deltas under sediment loads, and extraction of underground water, oil, or natural gas near the coast

Of course we all know that the Geologists and other such evil scientists in NASA are all in on some subversive plot to fool all of us.

Antarctica is losing ice at an accelerating rate.
<a href="http://geology.com/nasa/antarctic-ice-sheet-melting.shtml">Antarctic Ice Sheet Melting Speeds Up</a>

Ice loss in Antarctica increased by 75 percent in the last 10 years due to a speed-up in the flow of its glaciers and is now nearly as great as that observed in Greenland, according to a new, comprehensive study by NASA and university scientists.

In a first-of-its-kind study, an international team led by Eric Rignot of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and the University of California, Irvine, estimated changes in Antarctica's ice mass between 1996 and 2006 and mapped patterns of ice loss on a glacier-by-glacier basis. They detected a sharp jump in Antarctica's ice loss, from enough ice to raise global sea level by 0.3 millimeters (.01 inches) a year in 1996, to 0.5 millimeters (.02 inches) a year in 2006.

Rignot said the losses, which were primarily concentrated in West Antarctica's Pine Island Bay sector and the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, are caused by ongoing and past acceleration of glaciers into the sea. This is mostly a result of warmer ocean waters, which bathe the buttressing floating sections of glaciers, causing them to thin or collapse. "Changes in Antarctic glacier flow are having a significant, if not dominant, impact on the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet," he said.

And then there is the accelerating sea level rise

Antarctic Ice Sheet Melting Speeds Up
A NASA News Release - Janruary 23, 2008 Ice loss in Antarctica increased by 75 percent in the last 10 years due to a speed-up in the flow of its glaciers and is now nearly as great as that observed in Greenland, according to a new, comprehensive study by NASA and university scientists.

<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=117322">nsf.gov - National Science Foundation (NSF) News - Indian Ocean Sea-Level Rise Threatens Coastal Areas - US National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>

July 14, 2010

Indian Ocean sea levels are rising unevenly and threatening residents in some densely populated coastal areas and islands, a new study concludes.

The study, led by scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo., finds that the sea-level rise is at least partly a result of climate change.

Sea-level rise is particularly high along the coastlines of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, as well as the islands of Sri Lanka, Sumatra and Java, the authors found.

The rise--which may aggravate monsoon flooding in Bangladesh and India--could have future impacts on both regional and global climate.

OK. The 1996 article made predictions concerning the effects of sea level rise. Here are some of those predictions happening currently. Of course, the National Science Foundations is one of them thar commie organizations, right, Walleyes?

Keep telling yourself that crap! Spencer is a world renowned DENIER and Stuttering LimpTard THE Jackass' climatologist. Do you really think Spencer is going to fudge the numbers to favor global warming, especially after he was already caught fudging the data to make it colder???? Whatever Spencer "reports" you know it's warmer.

That is certainly a hypothesis worth figuring out. However, we do know from the Vostock ice cores that the CO2 levels rise around 800 years after a major warming period and lo and behold the MWP was 800 years ago, so it could just as likely be that mechanism at work again.

Ah, Walleyes, still as full of bullshit as usual.

<a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/07/temperature-ocean-life/">Warming of Oceans Will Reduce and Rearrange Marine Life | Wired Science | Wired.com</a>
The warmth of the ocean is the critical factor that determines how much productivity and biodiversity there is in the ocean, and where.

In two separate studies, researchers found that warming oceans have led to a massive decline in the amount of plant life in the sea over the last century, and that temperature is tightly linked to global patterns of marine biodiversity.

“We are just now understanding how deeply temperature affects ocean life,” said biologist Boris Worm of Dalhousie University, a co-author on both papers appearing July 28 in Nature. “It is not necessarily that increased temperature is destroying biodiversity, but we do know that a warmer ocean will look very different.”

In one study that looks at historical records of algae abundance over the last hundred years, Worm and his co-authors found that warming ocean temperatures are correlated to a massive decline in the amount of marine algae, or phytoplankton. Marine algae are the base of the entire ocean food chain, and were also responsible for originally creating oxygen on the planet.

The study estimates the decline in marine algae has been approximately 40 percent since 1950.

Around a dozen more records fell from Texas into the Southeast on Monday due to the unusually warm air that has enveloped the area for the past several days.

San Antonio, Texas; Alexandria, La.; Greenwood, Miss.; Tuscaloosa, Ala.; Orlando and Jacksonville, Fla.; and Raleigh, N.C., are among some of the cities and towns with new records on the books.

Afternoon high temperatures even flirted with the 100-degree mark in parts of Texas. Del Rio, Texas, had the hottest temperature in the nation on Monday, when the high reached 99 degrees and shattered the long-standing record of 92 degrees from 1917.

The exceptional warmth even reached into the mid-Atlantic Monday. In Philadelphia, a high temperature of 76 degrees, which is a whopping 14 degrees above normal, tied the record from 1993.

WASHINGTON — The government's National Climate Data Center reported Monday that the January-September period is tied with 1998 for the warmest first nine months on record.

The average temperature for the period was 1.17 degree Fahrenheit (0.65 Celsius) above normal for records going back 131 years, the agency said. For a full year the warmest on record was 2005.

It has been the warmest January-September on record in the Northern Hemisphere and the second warmest in the Southern Hemisphere, the agency noted.

Your argument is as empty as a paper bag.

The vast majority of the extreme weather is on the warming side.

That's the point.

actually you are empty as a paper bag. The majority of what your source is reporting may trend toward warming. While you will report evidence of cooling as evidence of warming.

Extreme weather is evidence of neither. Extreme weather is absolutely normal. Period.

You have a bias and seek to promote that bias, therefore you and what you post has negative credibility.

Try being honest instead. People might take you seriously.

Your arguments are based on manufactured, massaged and manipulated data and hyperbole.
