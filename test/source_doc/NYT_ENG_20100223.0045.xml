SPORTS COLUMN:A SCRIPT, OR WOODS '  ROAD TO RECOVERY?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tiger Woods' statement last week had the ring of the first step
toward treatment of an addiction. One hopes he becomes less Tiger
and more Eldrick.
</P>
<P>
The best thing I heard from Tiger Woods the other day was that
he is not coming back anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, I was convinced that he would materialize at the
Masters in April, assuring everybody he had beaten this thing and
was ready to see some azaleas again. Fore!
</P>
<P>
This is good. Woods has more important things to do, like
acquire an adult personality and find out why he got himself in
this trouble.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Woods story has been depicted through the prism
of the good old golf tour, titillating scandal, business sponsors
and the news media swarm. There is another prism -- the attempted
recovery of somebody who may now consider himself an addict.
</P>
<P>
The silliest thing I heard the other day was some people in a
sports bar -- the great big ubiquitous national sports bar --
commenting that Woods sounded scripted, as if that was so bad.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Woods has hidden behind his smug script as the
biggest name in golf, or maybe even the biggest name in sports,
deigning to make a few public remarks, cussing and glaring as he
went about his work, like a petulant child, and then slipping
around in the night.
</P>
<P>
His statement the other day sounded familiar. It was the script
of somebody who has realized he may have wrecked his marriage, hurt
people close to him, and now it is time to try to gain control over
his life. Powerless. Woods seemed to be saying he was powerless.
</P>
<P>
If that is the script, Woods should keep reciting from it, even
if the folks in blogland say he sounds robotic. His words sounded
to me as if they were a step, the first of the 12 steps of
addiction treatment: the admission of being powerless over
addiction.
</P>
<P>
The script was straight from the collective wisdom of Alcoholics
Anonymous and the other disciplines that give people a chance to
start again. All too often, rehabilitation centers wind up as punch
lines, sounding like some sort of Club Med with tissue boxes. But
sometimes, treatment centers can scare the tiger right out of
somebody.
</P>
<P>
Yes, we are all weary of public confessions from A-Rod and Mark
McGwire, but Woods' was quite different because he was talking
about an addiction, in this case sexual.
</P>
<P>
As part of those steps, Woods talked about how much he had hurt
people close to him, how he hoped to rebuild things someday. He
sounded scared and alone and unsure he would ever get it right
again.
</P>
<P>
Good, I thought. Somebody got to him.
</P>
<P>
My respect for rehab centers stems from 1981 when I was working
on a book with Bob Welch, a baseball player and a friend, who is an
alcoholic. I was allowed to spend a week at the center he had
attended -- as long as I participated. One of the best things I ever
did.
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the center was the Meadows, in Wickenburg, Ariz.,
where Woods is rumored to have gone last weekend. They did not go
easy on anybody at the Meadows.Ever since then, I have always been
dubious about athletes, fresh out of treatment, who show up back in
the clubhouse. Stinking thinking, they called it at the rehab
center. Grandiosity. It's not enough to learn the mechanics of
sobriety -- how not to put cocaine up the nose or beer down the
throat. People need to get at the feelings behind the addiction, or
else they never lose the flippancy, the anger, the insecurity. Dry
drunks, they're called. I've seen a few out in public.
</P>
<P>
Woods' words the other day sounded familiar. He seemed to have
been told that some people can never put their marriages back
together or regain the jobs they lost. They have to get clean
first, then take the first tentative steps out in the world.
</P>
<P>
He sounded like an outpatient who was going back for more work.
Reportedly, he and his wife and their two children were flown
somewhere over the weekend. At least he is not coming back to golf
right now.
</P>
<P>
Tiger Woods has always struck me as a stunted individual who
sneered at people and could afford expensive handlers to clean up
behind him. His haughtiness seemed to spring from the money and
entitlement of his sport.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time to stop being Tiger and start being Eldrick
Woods. Not a marketing ploy like some basketball superstar changing
his uniform number, but a statement: I'm growing up. I'm Eldrick
now. It's a thought.
</P>
<P>
The other day, Woods sounded different, like a guy who had been
scared. He doesn't really owe that much to the public or his
sponsors or the golf tour. He mostly owes it to himself and his
family and friends to get himself straight.
</P>
<P>
He could, however, send word to his caddie-enforcer, Steve
Williams, that this is not the best time to be threatening the
gallery over potential insults. Didn't Williams get the memo about
humility?
</P>
<P>
Maybe Woods will come back later this year, or whenever, and
remind us and himself that he is staying clean -- one day at a time.
From his respectful mention of Buddhism the other day, it sounds as
if he has a chance. Stay away, Eldrick. And whatever you do, stay
scripted.
