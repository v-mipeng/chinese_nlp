The Progressive Collapse Challenge!

THE PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE CHALLENGE

The challenge is in 5 parts, from the easiest to the most difficult.

All five require building a structure that will undergo top-down progressive total collapse -- i.e.: when disturbed near the top, it will collapse from the top down to the bottom, leaving no part standing. The disturbance can include mechanical force, such as projectile impacts, and fires, augmented with hydrocarbon fuels. Explosives and electromagnetic energy beams are not permitted.

Your structure can be made out of anything: straws, toothpicks, cards, dominoes, mud, vegetables, pancakes, etc.

The designers of the Twin Towers were able to meet all 5 challenges using steel and concrete.

CHALLENGE #1:

Build a structure with a vertical aspect ratio of at least 2 (twice as tall as it is wide) and induce it to undergo top-down total progressive collapse.

CHALLENGE #2:

Build a structure with a square footprint and a vertical aspect ratio of at least 6.5 (6.5 times as high as it is wide), and induce it to undergo top-down total progressive collapse.

CHALLENGE #3:

Build a structure as required by CHALLENGE #2 which, in the process of collapsing, will throw pieces outward in all directions such that at least 80% of the mass of the materials ends up lying outside of the footprint, but their center of mass lies inside the footprint.

CHALLENGE #4:

Build a structure as required by CHALLENGE #2 which is capable of remaining intact in 100 MPH cross wind.

CHALLENGE #5:

Build a structure that meets the requirements of both CHALLENGES #3 and #4.
Thanks to Mr. Hoffman for this challenge.

This has already been conclusively proven with mathematical models. There are no papers which have succeeded in refuting the basic concepts of these models.

Building models is foolish and expensive. Unless the "model" is exactly the same as the original, it will not scale loads, deflection and stress the same as each are exponetially (to the second, third and fourth powers) dependant upon distance.

I used to think that designing skycrapers was hard, and really smart engineers worked for years to figure out how to make them safe and economical. Now troofers have turned this idea on its head, and it is apparently impossible to construct a tall building that will collapse under any circumstances. Who knew?

THE PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE CHALLENGE
Your structure can be made out of anything: straws, toothpicks, cards, dominoes, mud, vegetables, pancakes, etc.

The designers of the Twin Towers were able to meet all 5 challenges using steel and concrete.

CHALLENGE #1:

Build a structure with a vertical aspect ratio of at least 2 (twice as tall as it is wide) and induce it to undergo top-down total progressive collapse.

CHALLENGE #2:

Build a structure with a square footprint and a vertical aspect ratio of at least 6.5 (6.5 times as high as it is wide), and induce it to undergo top-down total progressive collapse.

CHALLENGE #3:

Build a structure as required by CHALLENGE #2 which, in the process of collapsing, will throw pieces outward in all directions such that at least 80% of the mass of the materials ends up lying outside of the footprint, but their center of mass lies inside the footprint.

CHALLENGE #4:

Build a structure as required by CHALLENGE #2 which is capable of remaining intact in 100 MPH cross wind.

CHALLENGE #5:

Build a structure that meets the requirements of both CHALLENGES #3 and #4.
Thanks to Mr. Hoffman for this challenge.

</quote>
CHALLENGE #1:

Find a truther with a real fact ratio of at least 2 (twice as many facts as false conclusion) and use those facts to support a conclusion from 9/11 truth before the conclusion undergos top-down total progressive collapse.

CHALLENGE #2:

Build a conclusion with a fact or facts and at least 6.5 reasons(6.5 times as real as it is stupid), and support the conclusion with the facts instead of hearsay which now leads to top-down total progressive collapse.

CHALLENGE #3:

Build a conclusion as required by CHALLENGE #2 which, in the process of collapsing, will not throw lies outward in all directions such that at least 80% of the mass of the bs ends up lying outside of the conclusion, but their center of madness lies inside the footprint of lies and distortion of reality.

CHALLENGE #4:

Build a conclusion as required by CHALLENGE #2 which is capable of remaining intact in 100 attacks of real facts.

CHALLENGE #5:

Build a conclusion that meets the requirements of both CHALLENGES #3 and #4.

Thanks to Mr. Hoffman for collecting so much data on 9/11 that his supply of false information is so hidden, idiots in the truth movement ignore the facts and use just the BS. This is a Darwin type filter. It shows us the true idiots of the truth movement who think they are using logic, but only have BS. Loads of bs and stupid questions.

I'd do it.

Just give me unlimited funding (that's 1 followed by 10000000000000000000000 zeros at least). You see, I have to buy the plot of land in the middle of nowhere that is equal to the size of the entire WTC complex; build all 7 wtc buildings, and fill them with office equipment and carpeting, light fixtures, and replicate building 7 with the diesel tanks. Then I will need to purchase 2 planes, fully furnished and with test bodies (dead pigs can serve to simulate humans), and then fly them into the two Replicated twin towers.

And of course, we need to rebuild at least 20 times so that we can get a good test result each time we do replicate the event on 9/11/2001.

Gee, i wonder why real investigators and scientists and engineers use computer models these days.

</quote>
Firstly 80% pf the WTC tower material did not land outside of the towers footprint, only about 40% did, the main mass was concetrated in a compacted pile of concrete and mangeled trusses that filled the basements and then piled up about another 7 stories. Secondly according to the laws of physics, the CoM of a closed system must remain in a constant state. Basically what they tells us is that the CoM of the World Trade Towers much remain in the same place unless an outside force is applied to it. Since the only outside force applied was Gravity, which results in the CoM moving directly down, the laws of physics tell us that the CoM of the Towers MUST remain in the footprint. In fact it would have been a violation of the laws of physics for it to have not done so. Thus not only is the Challenge incorrect when compared to the WTC, it is absurd when compared to the laws of physics as written by Newton over 200 years ago.

Well to be blunt, Hoffman is an idiot and the challenge has been around for the last 4 years or longer and has been debunked almost as long. Riducle is likely the best response to those that continue to dig up trash from the past. I responded as I did because thereis a possiblity that some may not have seen it previously and might not realise how dumb it really is.

For example. Scaling a material results in the properties of the material changing at different rates. For example, if you take a steel column, the values for resistance to elastic deformation and volume are not linear to each other and scale. This means that if we take a smaller beam that has been scaled in size, it is actually proportionally stronger in its resistance to elastic deformation than the larger one would be. To give it a proportional resistance, you have to make the beam smaller, which then reduces the mass of the beam. You could change this by using a different material that gives you both mass and resitance, but now you have other problems such as how the beam reacts to heat and so forth. When it comes to the engineering world, scaling really creates more problems that it solves. Once the scaling issues and absurd questions based on Hoffman's ignorance are removed, you basically have him asking for a structure like the WTC, and since there are numerous real peer reviewed papers discussing the reasons for the progressive failure, including one that one of the posters (Apollo 20) here collaborated on, whereas there is not one properly peer reviewed paper disputing a progressive collapse, there is little need for such a challenge to be answered.

This is really quite a strange challenge, and one that exposes the lack of knowledge on the part of the challenger (Jim Hoffman). Any ordinary structure of sufficient height will exhibit this behavior, if you destroy a floor somewhere in the middle. Any structure.

For a given structure, you will find that there is a "safe zone" for which, if you destroy floor quite near the top, only results in a local collapse. Exactly how high up this zone is depends on the structure. Virtually any structure will not experience a progressive collapse if you only destroy the top floor, for example. But virtually any structure will collapse if the upper block created is, say, 10 floors or more.

The standards to beat are <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/405.pdf">Bazant and Zhou</a> and the update <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/00%20WTC%20Collapse%20-%20What%20did%20%26%20Did%20Not%20Cause%20It%20-%20Revised%206-22-07.pdf">BLBG</a> papers. Anyone who can falsify these papers may be on to something, and will receive my prompt attention. Anyone who cannot, who instead attempts to reroute the conversation through meaningless and ignorant "challenges," is talking out of his hat.

P.S.: <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/disinfo/experts/comments/bazantzhou.html">This</a> is not valid criticism of Bazant and Zhou, for reasons that should be self-evident. If you can't find the mistakes yourself, consult a scientist.

Since the only outside force applied was Gravity, which results in the CoM moving directly down, the laws of physics tell us that the CoM of the Towers MUST remain in the footprint. In fact it would have been a violation of the laws of physics for it to have not done so. Thus not only is the Challenge incorrect when compared to the WTC, it is absurd when compared to the laws of physics as written by Newton over 200 years ago.

i refer you to this post

<quote orig_author="PhantomWolf">
For example. Scaling a material results in the properties of the material changing at different rates. For example, if you take a steel column, the values for resistance to elastic deformation and volume are not linear to each other and scale. This means that if we take a smaller beam that has been scaled in size, it is actually proportionally stronger in its resistance to elastic deformation than the larger one would be. To give it a proportional resistance, you have to make the beam smaller, which then reduces the mass of the beam. You could change this by using a different material that gives you both mass and resitance, but now you have other problems such as how the beam reacts to heat and so forth. When it comes to the engineering world, scaling really creates more problems that it solves. Once the scaling issues and absurd questions based on Hoffman's ignorance are removed, you basically have him asking for a structure like the WTC, and since there are numerous real peer reviewed papers discussing the reasons for the progressive failure, including one that one of the posters (Apollo 20) here collaborated on, whereas there is not one properly peer reviewed paper disputing a progressive collapse, there is little need for such a challenge to be answered.

Swing, do you know anything at all about arithmetic? Scale down a tower by half and you decrease the weight by a factor of eight but the strength of the supporting members by only a factor of four. Fracture energy per floor goes down by a factor of eight, gravitational potential energy down by a factor of sixteen. And, of course, if a half size structure with reduced strength columns collapsed, you'd be the first to cry foul because the columns weren't the correct scale cross-section.

Actually, I'd like to propose a similar challenge to the truth movement. Using demolition charges of any design you like, place enough explosive in a heavily used multi-storey public building to initiate a total collapse without anybody noticing. I'm not suggesting that you should actually set off the charges, you understand. Some radio controlled device that unfurles a flag saying "Bang!" [1] would probably give the general idea. You can use any amount of manpower you like, although for extra credit the job should be done by three people in four weeks as per Scenario 404. Compromising the security systems may be tricky, but as we all know the truth movement comprises 46% of the population of the USA, so nearly half of the security staff should be happy to help out.

Swing Dangler, try the following experiment:

1. Hold an empty (or full, if you prefer, it doesn't matter, but empty is easier to clean up) drinking glass two meters above a smooth hard level floor.

2. Drop it.

Questions for post-experiment analysis:

1. Was any force other than gravity acting on the glass?

2. Were any explosives involved?

3. Did the pieces of the glass land in a neat pile where the glass contacted the floor, or were some of them projected outward?

4. If any pieces were projected outward, what mysterious force caused this?

5. (Advanced): As best you can tell, how did the maximum outward velocity of the pieces compare with the downward velocity of the glass at impact? Did any of them move outward faster than the falling speed, and if so, how is that possible?

Interesting. In both of the pictures that SD posted, I see an "umbrella" of debris falling down the sides of the building. That would mean that debris is falling at the speed of gravity. It would also mean, that since the collapse of the building isn't at the same level as the debris, the building isn't falling at the same speed.

If you look at Swing's post, it's clear he has read a lot of this thread - he quotes quite a few messages. But it's also clear, from his two lines above, that he has ignored (on purpose? Perhaps) the posts that deal with the main problems in this "challenge" in the most serious and thoughful manner - that being, the problems with scaling the structures such that the properties of the materials used is consistent with the full-scale buildings.

This is why we usually just goof on such inane challenges - we've seen this sort of behaviour before, and we know our most thoughtful respsonses will simply be ingnored. At some point, most people just get tired of putting in that effort, for no useful result. It used to be we'd kitten the hell out of a thread like this, but that is now frowned upon.

In any case, if you bring up a serious question that hasn't been beaten to death already, you'll find that a lot of people are still willing to discuss it reasonably. 9/11 topics are pretty much exhausted, but if you look at some of the other CTs we've discussed, you'll see some more serious posts.

THE PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE CHALLENGE

The challenge is in 5 parts, from the easiest to the most difficult.

All five require building a structure that will undergo top-down progressive total collapse -- i.e.: when disturbed near the top, it will collapse from the top down to the bottom, leaving no part standing. The disturbance can include mechanical force, such as projectile impacts, and fires, augmented with hydrocarbon fuels. Explosives and electromagnetic energy beams are not permitted.

Your structure can be made out of anything: straws, toothpicks, cards, dominoes, mud, vegetables, pancakes, etc.

The designers of the Twin Towers were able to meet all 5 challenges using steel and concrete.

CHALLENGE #1:

Build a structure with a vertical aspect ratio of at least 2 (twice as tall as it is wide) and induce it to undergo top-down total progressive collapse.

CHALLENGE #2:

Build a structure with a square footprint and a vertical aspect ratio of at least 6.5 (6.5 times as high as it is wide), and induce it to undergo top-down total progressive collapse.

CHALLENGE #3:

Build a structure as required by CHALLENGE #2 which, in the process of collapsing, will throw pieces outward in all directions such that at least 80% of the mass of the materials ends up lying outside of the footprint, but their center of mass lies inside the footprint.

CHALLENGE #4:

Build a structure as required by CHALLENGE #2 which is capable of remaining intact in 100 MPH cross wind.

CHALLENGE #5:

Build a structure that meets the requirements of both CHALLENGES #3 and #4.
Thanks to Mr. Hoffman for this challenge.

Collisions cause that, not gravity.

Here's an idea. Take a supply of marbles, or gravel, or something similar, and dump it out of a container toward the ground. Will it all fall neatly, straight down, and end up in a nice vertical pile? Or will the particles' collisions with the ground and each other force them to spread out on the way down?

The same thing happens here. When a collapsing section of a building falls and slams into the floors below, the momentum of the falling debris gets redirected horizontally as it continues to fall.

It's quite simple, actually. Stuff above is falling just a little faster than stuf below can get out of the way. So the stuff above has to go somewhere. Some of it rides up over the stuff that is blowing straight out.

The stuff that is slightly lifted is not really going very high. It just appears that way because the stuff below has moved odwnward a little bit before the stuff that was lifted can start falling.

When stuff starts moving, it has to go somewhere until it runs out of energy or hits something.

Is that simple enough for a twoofer mind to grasp?

For those out there who think that the force of gravity cannot force impact debris UPWARDS, let me assure you that I have physical proof that it can!

When I was about 10 years old I did a little experiment in my back yard. I balanced a piece of wood, (about 6 inches long and 1 inch round) on a metal frame several inches off the ground. Then, while standing over this set-up, I dropped, from a height of about 4 feet, a 16 pound iron ball (a sports shot put no less), onto one side of the balanced piece of wood.

Well guess what happened?

Let me tell you!

The piece of wood flew upwards with great velocity and smashed into my nose! I was almost knocked unconscious and wound up with a nasty broken nose and blood splattered all over my face!

I still have the scars and a crooked nose as proof!

Yes, that's one physics lesson I will never forget!

Oh, and one more point - I swear that piece of wood would have shot 50 feet in the air if my nose hadn't got in the way!

Here's something, Swing, to practice with. You can make it collapse at any point you want to. If you can get yourself some scaled down aluminum cladding for the outside perimeter, it may withstand scaled down wind speeds resembling 100 mph.

<a href="http://www.debunking911.com/jones.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/jones.htm</a>

The video below shows a large section of perimeter columns leaning over to land flat on it's face.

Like cutting the top of a milk carton off and slitting the corner edges - the walls lean over to land flat on it's face. Some easily hit the Winter Garden building.

As you can see, the building never caught fire so it was never in any danger of collapse. The evidence points to a combination of unfought fire and damage which brought down the WTC 7. That's what the NIST draft said as well. The Bankers Trust was also constructed differently, with a web column design. The interior columns were not pushed out to the perimeter.

Note the WTC columns laid out as if there were a path to the building. There are no concrete slabs attached to columns.

With the floors pancaking straight down, the perimeter walls were free to lean over in tall sections before breaking off and coming down. That's what gave them distance.

The above photo illustrates just how far the perimeter columns could have gone. If the columns didn't break up as they leaned out they could have made a path to the Hudson river. Reaching Building 7 and the Winter Garden would have been well within reason.

I haven't posted in this thread yet, but I wanted to make sure you had noticed this:

If you look at Swing's post, it's clear he has read a lot of this thread - he quotes quite a few messages. But it's also clear, from his two lines above, that he has ignored (on purpose? Perhaps) the posts that deal with the main problems in this "challenge" in the most serious and thoughful manner - that being, the problems with scaling the structures such that the properties of the materials used is consistent with the full-scale buildings.

This is why we usually just goof on such inane challenges - we've seen this sort of behaviour before, and we know our most thoughtful respsonses will simply be ingnored. At some point, most people just get tired of putting in that effort, for no useful result. It used to be we'd kitten the hell out of a thread like this, but that is now frowned upon.

In any case, if you bring up a serious question that hasn't been beaten to death already, you'll find that a lot of people are still willing to discuss it reasonably. 9/11 topics are pretty much exhausted, but if you look at some of the other CTs we've discussed, you'll see some more serious posts.

It isn't the most rigorous of challenges, I'll admit.

Time will only tell if the subject of 9/11 is indeed exhausted.

Thanks for the reply.

Well, if you have more than a few it may start a progressive collapse and the possibility of ejecting 80 percent of your "debris" outside your foot print unless you want some messy shoes.

Swing - could you answer a simple question for me? If I build a structure that meets the dimensional requirements of Challenge #2, does it have to withstand 100 mph wind, or a wind that is scaled properly for the ratio between the size of my model and the size of the WTC towers?

Bonus question: if I build a 1:100 scale model, what would be required wind speed for my model to produce the equivalent effects of a 100 mph wind on the WTC towers?

Then it's not a martini.

Here's something, Swing, to practice with. You can make it collapse at any point you want to. If you can get yourself some scaled down aluminum cladding for the outside perimeter, it may withstand scaled down wind speeds resembling 100 mph.

Nice Jenga. Now, you will have to remove "one level" all at the same time to get symmetrical failure at all critical points. Or better yet, separate the the top few levels of the Jinga, lift the top remaining levels and drop it onto the bottom part.
Global collapse or did the top slide off the rest of the structure that still stands?

It might be considered ridiculous if you choose to use silly materials.
Scale the structure down using similar materials as used in the towers.
Is there any chance of reducing the costs in order by scaling down the project down for the challenge?

Including the relevant materials that were found in the towers could be used as well, of course.

When you scale down in size you also scale the mass down as the materials are less dense. You also scale down the forces involved (gravity). It would be nearly impossible to model somthing the scale of a WTC tower accurately for any meaningful engineering purposes. As I have stated a 1/100th scale model would have to weight half a ton to even begin to replicate the force of gravity on the structure. Now accomplish that with materials in the.5-1mm thickness range.

I agree with the physics part, but how does gravity force debris up and out instead of down? <a href="http://www.ae911truth.net/images/explo2.jpg">http://www.ae911truth.net/images/explo2.jpg</a> and here-

Watch the video again. The debris is not going up and out.
