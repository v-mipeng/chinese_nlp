<P>
A mistyped permit application for filming of the CBS TV show "Hawaii Five-0" led to a rush-hour traffic jam in East Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
"Hawaii Five-0" wanted to shoot from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, a request that state officials said would have been denied.
</P>
<P>
The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday that instead, the application asked for a 10 a.m. to noon slot.
</P>
<P>
That resulted in filming that lasted seven hours longer than the two hours the state had approved for the area, which tied up traffic.
