Occupy Wall Street better defend its identity

Be careful of special interest groups hijacking the message. That's what happened to the Tea Party leading them to be co-opted into the Fox News GOP. Even if people show up who you agree with on some political issue, ask yourselves if that issue is actually related to what the protest is about. There will be, and probably already are, many factions who want nothing more than to turn the entire movement into a DNC fundraiser. Suddenly it will be about collective bargaining for teachers or something else that doesn't involve a corporation at all, let alone Wall Street. The partisans on both sides will try and expand their trenches such that your movement falls into them. Keep an eye out, don't be the next Tea Party.

I'm not there, so I don't know, but that's what tends to happen with these things. They must agree on a message and stick to it, if they let special interests show up and hijack the thing.. even if they agree with those interests.. it'll become a dissolute and meaningless partisan mob like the Tea Party did.

Sounds speculative, got a cite? The media at this point seems to be just guessing / asking random people. Haven't personally read anything about the protests that reminded me of Marx, anarchy or Ron Paul.

(Edit)Well ok I've now seen a few pics showing outright communists there.. Might be a good idea for any of the non-commies to distance themselves from that sort of thing, I mean obviously you can't stop communists from showing up but please don't encourage them.

They want more government, less government, more immigration, protectionism, etc etc. They protest corporations even as they organize on Facebook and Twitter and Youtube using laptop computers and smart phones, all fruits of corporations. They rail against oil companies while powering generators with gasoline. They want to end capitalism, while also getting better pay. What entity will pay them absent capitalism I have no idea.

Actually, they could use a few hundred union organizers to help them focus. THe destruction of the working class and small entrepreneurs by the useless faction of the investor class is what got us to the sorry state we are in today. Those people on the street have a lot more in common with a teacher being forced out of the union by Il Duce than they have with the poor sod who just lost all his trust fund in the derivatives market.

That's why the republicons are trying to bust unions now. They are the last effective rallying point for people who get screwed over by slime like the Koch roaches and the Walton larvae.

Here are some background links that explain why these protests (is that even the right word?) have been conducted they way they have.

There is a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/youre-creating-a-vision-of-the-sort-of-society-you-want-to-have-in-miniature/2011/08/25/gIQAXVg7HL_blog.html">recent interview</a> on the Washington Post website with David Graeber, who was one of the early organizers and is an anthropologist at Goldsmiths, University of London.

The Post has a related <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/occupy-wall-street-a-primer/2011/08/25/gIQAbX7oHL_blog.html">primer</a>, and The Nation has what they call a <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/163719/occupy-wall-street-faq">FAQ</a> about Occupy Wall Street.

For you wonky types, a blogger named Mike Konczal (of whom I had never heard before) takes a closer look at <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/09/30/understanding-the-theory-behind-the-different-approach-of-the-occupy-wall-street-protests/">the theory behind Occupy Wall Street's approach</a>.

This debate about structure and process has been going on for generations among U.S. social democrats and people farther to their left. For example, these questions came up again during the alter-globalization movements around the millennium. Doug Henwood has <a href="http://lbo-news.com/2011/09/29/the-occupy-wall-street-non-agenda/">a critique</a> of Occupy Wall Street from (it seems to me) the conservative end of that spectrum.

That FAQ is pretty funny.

"
What are the demands of the protesters?

Ughthe zillion-dollar question. Again, the original Adbusters call asked, What is our one demand? Technically, there isnt one yet....

... to begin with, they opted to make their demand the occupation itselfand the direct democracy taking place therewhich in turn may or may not come up with some specific demand. When you think about it, this act is actually a pretty powerful statement against the corruption that Wall Street has come to represent. But since thinking is often too much to ask of the American mass media, the question of demands has turned into a massive PR challenge."

No, actually, when you think about it, you realize that this is a copout to paper over the fact that these people have little to unify them beyond dissatisfaction with mainstream society. But let's pretend that it's the media's fault that we're incoherent.

Capitalism is permissible in a rational society. The capitalists just have to know what their job is and do it. The dirtbags running the financial sector now have forgotten or don't care that they are supposed to be moving money to places where tangible products are produced.

The world lived quite well without capitalists before and can, for a brief period, do so again, if need be.

The unions are actually capable of running the factories, if it comes to that.

Half the suits have no idea what makes their products work any way.

Not sure what you mean by that. A rational society would include some elements of socialism, but only as regards the ecconomny and providing social services.

Really? If that's the case, if management is just there to oppress labor, why haven't the unions at Boeing started their own aerospace company? Full of wealth and innovation and productivity and competitiveness?

Why haven't the unions at Ford started their own motor corporation? Vouchsafing to the world true car manufacturing greatness?

Why haven't the unions started their own airline, with more legroom, better meals, and revenues that put the capitalist airlines to shame?

ETA: It's been done, of course. The Soviet Union had all these things. Soviet aerospace thrived only in so far as it was part of the Soviet military-industrial complex. Soviet automobile industry? India has a more prominent automotive industry than the Soviet Union! Soviet airlines? Aeroflot, anyone?

I noticed tonight that people passing by the occupation were asking questions and the occupiers were answering them. Quite a concept there. What I overheard didn't surprise me, something about the unfairness of having to service debts that were created in bad faith by creditors with enough political clout to cover their own butts.

Some PSLers were there too, but I think they've totally missed the boat on this.

My understanding is that the protest started as a response to the bad behavior of the Wall Street banks that got us into the financial mess we're in now, required us to bail them out with taxpayer dollars, and yet don't seem to have changed their ways all that much (in some cases using our bailout money to give the responsible parties big bonuses).

I'm guessing that not everyone at these protests is against corporations or capitalism in general.

The problem is there is no message beyond "Wall Street bad!" So you have disparate groups who agree on that but disagree on what to do about it (regulation, dissalution, criminal trials, etc.) On top of that, you have fringe groups adding in unrelated demands such as legalizing marijuana or independance of Puerto Rico.

Sure, but I don't think it's necessary for protestors to agree on a single solution to what they're protesting. Maybe they just want Congress to actually agree on a plan for making sure it doesn't happen again, which might include any of the above that you mentioned.

Enforcing the laws they already broke by imprisoning 1000s of them (like with Savings and Loan in the 90s) is the way to deter it from happening again. There's no way to "make sure", criminals will always dream up a new scam, or a new way of dressing up an old one.

Congress isn't helping by repealing things like Glass Steagal but the core problem is the SEC and Justice Department who refuse to bring criminal charges against a single banker. Even Madoff had to turn himself in, they certainly weren't going to stop him. Regulatory capture trumps anything you can do on the legislative side.. A law is just toilet paper if that's all the "police" are using it for.

Earlier today, the AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, and Transit Workers' Union are among the groups that stood in solidarity with the hundreds of mostly young men and women who have spent the better part of three weeks sleeping, eating, and organizing from Zuccotti Square.

Their arrival was touted as a watershed moment for the "Occupy" movement, which has now seen copycat protests spring up across the country. And while the specific demands of the "occupiers" remain wide-ranging, the presence of the unions – implicitly inclined to making more direct demands – may sharpen their focus.

And if Congress comes up with a plan that they don't agree with (as an example, the libertarians aren't going to want the same plan the communists would like) what then? More protests while one group bows out?

Pretty much what I've been saying, public sector unions as a special interest group have no real grievance with Wall Street. If anyone thinks they showed up just because they love the sight of smiling hippies you better get your heads out of the sand. Public Unions are very political, very large establishment organizations.. It's way too early for a leaderless movement that hasn't yet even codified its basic principles or grievances to start forging alliances like this one. They will end up as the tail, not the dog. The Tea Party should have chased out Fox News at the start and the OWS movement ought to be chasing out these big DNC public union folks.

No, but it would make the protest much more credible if they had a single issue on which they were protesting.

There seems to be a common thread having to do with the rich and powerful disproportionately benefiting from government while everyone else pays for it.

There are a number of related issues from campaign finance reform to foreclosures, but they all seem to revolve more or less around the same common thread. I don't think that's unexpected with a crowd that size.

Why wouldn't you? Do you think you could find two people with exactly the same goals? The whole point of a protest is to join other people who have a goal in common and hope that the numbers will pressure politicians to act towards that goal.

In this case, the common goal seems to be to make things more equitable between the rich/powerful and the middle class. And according to recent polls, the vast majority of Americans agree with the sentiment.

Really? If that's the case, if management is just there to oppress labor, why haven't the unions at Boeing started their own aerospace company? Full of wealth and innovation and productivity and competitiveness?...

</quote>
Because, as society is currently structured, it takes capital, and a staggering amount of it at that.

</quote>
So, unions aren't capable of running the factories, then?

In any system, someone supplies tools (capital) and someone supplies skilled labor. Finance is a tool, and the skilled labor that wields it is called "management" and sometimes "the investor class". As the United Airlines dispute between the pilots' union and the machinists' union (the owners), on the one hand and the flight attendants' union, on the other, over the appropriate shares of UA revenues indicates, unionization does not confer any special wisdom regarding how to resolve the disputes over "just" compensation.

As an aside, I read that the "Occupy Wall Street" website has posted a recommendation against making lists of demands, after critics used one list to paint them as loons. Yah, they're morons. I reacll one demand: forgiveness of all debt. Personal, corporate, and sovereign. Wipe the slate clean and start from today. Well, who owns any tangible asset that's partially paid for, like a house with a thirty-year mortgage or a hospital's new emergency diesel-electric generator? Does "debt forgiveness" mean that corporations don't have to keep pension promises? Does forgiveness of sovereign debt mean that the US government gets to discount to zero its Social Security obligations? Morons.

The protestors are stupid frontmen for a union-orchestrated pressure play. It's extortion, behind the scenes. "Give us money and we'll call them off".

Clearly these organizations believe that putting/keeping democrats in office will bring them "personal gain" or the large amount of money they spend doing just that would seem rather silly. There's an obvious motive for them to try and inject partisan union issues to the protests and assimilate the OWS movement into the DNC.

Enforcing the laws they already broke by imprisoning 1000s of them (like with Savings and Loan in the 90s) is the way to deter it from happening again. There's no way to "make sure", criminals will always dream up a new scam, or a new way of dressing up an old one.

Congress isn't helping by repealing things like Glass Steagal but the core problem is the SEC and Justice Department who refuse to bring criminal charges against a single banker.

As for particular people, Fabrice Tourre. Anyone materially involved with the GS fraud against their clients involving John Paulson.. Hell, anyone involved in misrepresenting the quality of CMBS could be charged with fraud, when money is changing hands based on knowingly false or incomplete information the executive branch could make a case if they felt like it. They don't feel like it.

And hey how about the fraud shops where people were paid $10/hr to sign other people's names on mortgage documents? Good old fashioned forgery mills.

How about anyone involved in setting up that outfit? How bout anyone who had knowledge of these felonies while they were being committed? Much like with a roach infestation these are just the criminals I can see crawling around out in the open, if the Justice Dept were brave enough to look behind the fridge we could likely get up to the several thousands of indictments we saw in the 1990s the last time banks decided laws were only for poor people.

Why are you sure of this? Joining a protest with no motivation to do so would be silly. Joining a protest as part of an organisation because you're a member of that organisation and the structure is useful for transport and mutual support, while having the motivation to do so because you personally support the political agenda without anticipating gain for the organisation you attend with is a perfectly reasonable scenario. I don't really see why you're arguing with this.

As to pointless, protests may not often achieve the goals they set out to do, but in protesting they show that there is a motivated opposition to whatever it is they are protesting against. A government attempting to make 20% cuts to X public service, seeing no protest, may just go ahead and make 30% cuts. A government seeing a huge outcry may change course and make 10% cuts. If you insist, I can find you plenty of examples of protests that have succeeded, but I'm guessing it was just hyperbole.

The unions are not committing a crime being there. They have an obligation to be there. The class warfare being waged by the Koch roaches and their brethern on Wall Street will, if successful, take down union and non-union labor along with the small entrepreneurs who used to provide most of the jobs in this country.

The unions created the middle class in this country. They made it possible for a working man to rise above the station into which he was born. The fought for safer working conditions.

They forced the capitalists to treat workers like human beings rather than like expendible industrial equipment.

The banksters and the money-gamers have screwed people across the ecconomic spectrum. High-tech workers whose jobs have been sold to China and the carpenter who has been laid off because people can no longer afford to buy the homes they build have more in common with the unions than with slime who have taken billions in tax cuts on the fraudulent theory that they "create jobs."

Maybe half the people in the occupation have no idea how to fix the mess that this ecconomy is in, but they know where the people who caused the problem hang out.

The unions know what to do about it. The neophyte protestors need the advice that the unions can give them in regards to logistics and effective communications. They also know what wil fix the situation. The unions are fighting to fix the ecconomy by keeping jobs here, ensuring the safety of workers and the ability of their families to survive temporary setbacks, by ensuring that workers will have a dignified retirement and that a day's work will earn a worker a day's provisions.

That many workers do not get these benefits is hurting the other, non-union victims of the slow-down.

But, because the corporate media have so suppressed the truth and have so distorted what the unions have been fighting for, some people actually blame the unions. It is time to fight back.

The unions did not send the jobs off shore. The unions did not decide that an executive should make more money based on the price of a company's stock. The unions did not come up with the idea that you can make more money by putting factories out of business than by actually making anything.

The rotten little weasels on Wall Street did that.

The unions know how to fight them. The unions are the natural allies of all of those people whoi have seen their futures turn from dreams to nightmares while people who make nothing but money get richer than can possibly be good for America.

Did you read my links about how Chicago union bosses got a sweetheart pension law passed for labor bosses in return for union support? The other one showing Illinois' public pensions are underfunded by $80 billion, and the recent 66% tax increase went entirely to paying off pension benefits&gt; How Gov. Quinn cut a deal with the unioins just prior to the election agreeing not to lay off any union worker until after 2012? And how the budget will have to be cut in other areas solely to keep unneeded union members on the payroll?

Public unions have so much influence over Springfield they received benefits the state simply cannot afford. Corporations are threatening to flee the state to avoid the tax hikes they anticipate coming to fund the $80 billion state pension deficit. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-1006-tax-breaks-push-20111006,0,4869131.story">Big companies are negotiating deals to stay</a>, small companies just move with little fanfare or notice except to their few employees.

We're talking about public sector unions here, not the unions that created the middle class. While FDR and the unions were creating said middle class FDR was strongly opposed to the at-the-time-crazy notion of public employees being able to strike and collectively bargain. So let's keep that separate.

The public unions don't have problems with Wall Street, they have problems with republicans. The more influence they have within the OWS movement the more it will be about two-party politics and the nameless "rich" and the less it will be about Wall Street (which is a DNC ally).

I'm sure most of the union's members do have a negative attitude toward Wall Street, damn near everyone does. The organization itself though is a powerhouse of two-party politics..

The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations. The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters.

Particularly, I want to emphasize my conviction that militant tactics have no place in the functions of any organization of Government employees. Upon employees in the Federal service rests the obligation to serve the whole people, whose interests and welfare require orderliness and continuity in the conduct of Government activities. This obligation is paramount. Since their own services have to do with the functioning of the Government, a strike of public employees manifests nothing less than an intent on their part to prevent or obstruct the operations of Government until their demands are satisfied. Such action, looking toward the paralysis of Government by those who have sworn to support it, is unthinkable and intolerable. It is, therefore, with a feeling of gratification that I have noted in the constitution of the National Federation of Federal Employees the provision that "under no circumstances shall this Federation engage in or support strikes against the United States Government."

Why wouldn't you? Do you think you could find two people with exactly the same goals? The whole point of a protest is to join other people who have a goal in common and hope that the numbers will pressure politicians to act towards that goal.

In this case, the common goal seems to be to make things more equitable between the rich/powerful and the middle class. And according to recent polls, the vast majority of Americans agree with the sentiment.

And I agree with it too. But this alliance won't last when someone finally starts to think of what should be done to make it happen. And then all the protests will be for naught and we'll be back to square one.

Or more likely, given the new groups entering the fray, the whole thing will be coopted by the American labor unions and we'll still be back to square one.

The problem is you're thinking that everyone does have the same goal, bt they don't. They have the same TARGET. And that is completely different.

Did you read my links about how Chicago union bosses got a sweetheart pension law passed for labor bosses in return for union support? The other one showing Illinois' public pensions are underfunded by $80 billion, and the recent 66% tax increase went entirely to paying off pension benefits&gt; How Gov. Quinn cut a deal with the unioins just prior to the election agreeing not to lay off any union worker until after 2012? And how the budget will have to be cut in other areas solely to keep unneeded union members on the payroll?

Public unions have so much influence over Springfield they received benefits the state simply cannot afford. Corporations are threatening to flee the state to avoid the tax hikes they anticipate coming to fund the $80 billion state pension deficit. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-1006-tax-breaks-push-20111006,0,4869131.story">Big companies are negotiating deals to stay</a>, small companies just move with little fanfare or notice except to their few employees.

I gave it a second chance and read all the way through, and it was just what the first few pages implied, a hit piece that simply assumes that everyone on Wall Street is pure evil and that the SEC and Justice Department actively conspire with them to protect them. Without these assumptions his "evidence" which consists entirely of hearsay and more assumptions of evil presented in an extremely one sided way isn't very compelling. And it seems that he is completely unaware that errors and poor business decisions can be made without evil motives. And he is all over the place. For most of the article he accuses the SEC and Justice Department of being evil conspirators, then at the end, switches gears and claims that all government employees are stupid and everyone on Wall Street is super duper smart and that is how they get away with all of this vague fraud.

Perhaps the problem is that he seems to think that saying, "some guys told me that Wall Street is evil" is a perfectly valid reason to throw people in jail, whereas the SEC and Justice Department need actual evidence of wrongdoing to go after someone. "Someone told me..." may be good enough for Michele Bachman but it isn't good enough to bring charges and certainly isn't good enough to get a conviction.

This is much better, although it is difficult to see how this will lead to anyone on Wall Street getting locked up, banks will say they outsourced work to a third party, and that third party engaged in fraud, and it has been shut down and is being investigated. Companies outsource work all of the time, if you hire a call center to do some marketing for you, and the call center employees commit fraud, you won't be in trouble but they will be.

I don't think this will amount to a positive impact on the political process. Things are too polarized. Like the Tea Party, the initial rage would probably get focused by one group and others will lose interest. Net result is no meaningful change or worse (like the Tea Party) negative change.

The rage is legitimate, but I think the people involved are too small in number. We'd need much, much larger protests involving tons of people across the political spectrum. Certainly the political situation from both parties justifies a lot of anger, but I don't see such a protest happening anytime soon. I don't think we're likely to see much change for a long time.

You've highlighted a few cases of downright stupid corruption, and tried to extrapolate that to mean that all public unions do more bad than good, and that they are the primary reason for the state deficit in your state, and as a result they shouldn't be involved in a protest that on paper should coincide quite strongly with the standard political views of their membership.

And I disagree. I don't see how any of that necessarily protects government workers from unfair working conditions, bad training, or the like. They have a right to protest that.

Certainly, in some cases full-on striking can't be allowed. Police, firefighters, and others that people depend on to maintain order and save lives have to do their job. There's no reason not to allow collective bargaining or the like, however.

I suppose you might be able to get around that by having laws allowing government employees to sue the government if something bad is going on. That has its own problems, however.

Oh yeash, government work is frought with hazards. It was all sweatshops before collective bargaining! "Unfair dismissal", that's a good one! I don'f know what a unionized employee has to do to get fired. 25% of the CTA workforce doesn't show up on Monday or Friday. 30% of garbage collectors in Chicago don't show up on any given day. The absentee rate is 25% for toll collectorsw. Those aren't numbers of a workforce that thinks there's even a remote possiblity of getting fired.

And while government employees get generous retirement benefits and 100% free healthcare (even after becoming eligible for Medicare) the 99% of Illinoisans who aren't public employees get to pay for them. Grandma gets evicted from her nursing home, the poor get fewer services, state vendors don't get paid for 1-2 years after fulfilling their contracts (and many have gone bust waiting to get paid), roads don't get repaired, schools don't get repaired. All because the unions get theirs first, the rest of us have to get by on the scraps.

It's a running joke here that soon we won't have any public employees in Illinois, because 100% of our tax revenue will be going to pensions and health care to the retired employees. It's not too far off actually, right now 17% of the Illinois budget goes to retirement benefits of public employees. This number will only go up. Businesses are fleeing the state, because they know taxes will rise to pay for this largesse.

You've highlighted a few cases of downright stupid corruption, and tried to extrapolate that to mean that all public unions do more bad than good, and that they are the primary reason for the state deficit in your state, and as a result they shouldn't be involved in a protest that on paper should coincide quite strongly with the standard political views of their membership. You've not made a very convincing argument as of yet.

So how are we doing for numbers here anyways ?

Is the protest movement "the 99%" even coming close to making up 1% of the population ? It's not looking so good for occupy Vancouver, according to a news report I just read, they're only expecting 2000 people tomorrow, and that's opening day. So 2000 people out of a (greater Vancouver) population of 2 million works out to.

One tenth of 1 percent.

I have a suggestion for a demand. Prohibit credit companies from punishing merchants who offer a percentage off for cash discount. Seems t me most of the whining about debt loads centers around credit cards as much as student loans and this will give people incentive to not simply slap it on the card but to think about their buying habits on the way to the bank machine.

I showed you that Illinois public pensions are underfunded by $80 billion, and it has bankrupted our state. If you include county and municipal public pensions the figure is nearly double that, $150 billion or so.

</quote>
No, you didn't. You linked me to some articles (one of which says "read the other editorial" on a page with about 50 links) saying that illinois was tens of billions in debt and had tens of billions of pensions obligations (doesn't specify over how many years those will be paid out), and then added the figures in yourself. You then peppered this with a few examples, and left completely alone the issue of how much an average pension was or anything along those lines.

I'm not purely partisan, if you can show me that average pensions in illinois are higher than elsewhere, or higher than can be argued fair or neccessary, i'll concede the point (that collective bargaining for pensions is badly handled in some situations, not that public sector unions are inherently a bad idea). But you haven't done that yet.

<quote orig_author="WildCat">
Doesn't just sound like it, it is a bad system. I'd say the odds of underfunding such a system approach 100%.

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government_Pension_Fund_of_Norway">Norwegian Pension Fund</a> is doing pretty well too.

Oh yeash, government work is frought with hazards. It was all sweatshops before collective bargaining! "Unfair dismissal", that's a good one!

Be careful of special interest groups hijacking the message. That's what happened to the Tea Party leading them to be co-opted into the Fox News GOP. Even if people show up who you agree with on some political issue, ask yourselves if that issue is actually related to what the protest is about. There will be, and probably already are, many factions who want nothing more than to turn the entire movement into a DNC fundraiser. Suddenly it will be about collective bargaining for teachers or something else that doesn't involve a corporation at all, let alone Wall Street.

So, unions aren't capable of running the factories, then?

In any system, someone supplies tools (capital) and someone supplies skilled labor. Finance is a tool, and the skilled labor that wields it is called "management" and sometimes "the investor class". As the United Airlines dispute between the pilots' union and the machinists' union (the owners), on the one hand and the flight attendants' union, on the other, over the appropriate shares of UA revenues indicates, unionization does not confer any special wisdom regarding how to resolve the disputes over "just" compensation.

As an aside, I read that the "Occupy Wall Street" website has posted a recommendation against making lists of demands, after critics used one list to paint them as loons. Yah, they're morons. I reacll one demand: forgiveness of all debt. Personal, corporate, and sovereign. Wipe the slate clean and start from today. Well, who owns any tangible asset that's partially paid for, like a house with a thirty-year mortgage or a hospital's new emergency diesel-electric generator? Does "debt forgiveness" mean that corporations don't have to keep pension promises? Does forgiveness of sovereign debt mean that the US government gets to discount to zero its Social Security obligations? Morons.

The protestors are stupid frontmen for a union-orchestrated pressure play. It's extortion, behind the scenes. "Give us money and we'll call them off".

You might want to read your articles again, they do mention some cases where charges were brought. But I suspect it is that big shot executives haven't been indicted that has you upset. Fining banks for such actions is one thing, bringing criminal charges against individual employees is much more difficult. To get a conviction, prosecutors would almost certainly have to prove that individuals were knowingly, not unwittingly, involved in money laundering. You might also want to consider that your articles mention changes that banks have made to make it more difficult to launder money through them.

How were they advertised, packaged etc? What are these credit standards on? Lending or investing?

There are a lot of types of mortgages and investments based off of them, as well as differences between lending a person money and investing in an existing loan. It isn't made clear by that article what it means when it says that the mortgages violated the company's internal standards (which would not necessarily be fraud anyway). Are they loans that the company wouldn't have lent out themselves but was willing to invest in, and so on? A lot more information and clarification is needed to accurately comment on that passage in the article.

You're thinking of private sector unions.

I don't think there's any particular reason why a government can't be abusive towards its employees. In fact, historically there's a lot of evidence that governments can treat people unfairly.

What do you think the proper recourse is if a government employee is experience unsafe working conditions and his immediate boss and their bosses can't or won't do anything about it?

<quote orig_author="Emperor_Gestahl">
Why didn't they all just go straight to the DNC then? Why waste all this time when the DNC already holds rallies and fundraisers they could attend? Glomming onto the first massive political organization that came along is more or less what the Tea Party did.

</quote>
Frankly, the Tea Party allied itself largely with the people/party that supported most of their (anti-government) views.

<quote orig_author="Emperor_Gestahl">
No to the first, yes to the second. The unions have every motive to be there, it's good strategy for both them and the democratic party. They've got republicans to defeat. The protesters however had better be perfectly comfortable becoming part of the DNC and therefore allied with Wall Street before they get too cozy with these partisans.

</quote>
The GOP is even more allied with Wall Street. I agree both OCW and the Tea Party are missing the point regarding what's going on (e.g. unseemly corporate influence on the government). Unfortunately, the current level of outrage being shown isn't far too small to really shake things up.

On the other hand, they might get some people they like elected, like the Tea Party. Some good might come out of it, depending on how things go. They do seem unlikely to elect anyone that's going to try to stop the government from doing anything, which is a plus.

<quote orig_author="Emperor_Gestahl">
If you read the FDR piece you'd understand that "the government" is in fact us. Also it's them. We're not talking about faceless unelected officials here, if the people feel that teachers or firemen or whoever is downtrodden it's quite simple to fix legislatively.

Tyranny of the majority? Ever heard of it?

The current situation in government is actually a good example of how it is NOT easy to fix these things. A corrupt government is hard to influence unless you are one of the corrupting forces. People generally do feel education is in trouble, yet more often than not we get total crap for legislation IF ANYTHING. Unions have a place.

How were they advertised, packaged etc? What are these credit standards on? Lending or investing?

There are a lot of types of mortgages and investments based off of them, as well as differences between lending a person money and investing in an existing loan. It isn't made clear by that article what it means when it says that the mortgages violated the company's internal standards (which would not necessarily be fraud anyway). Are they loans that the company wouldn't have lent out themselves but was willing to invest in, and so on? A lot more information and clarification is needed to accurately comment on that passage in the article.

' <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-k-black/the-two-documents-everyon_b_169813.html">The Two Documents Everyone Should Read to Better Understand the Crisis</a> ', - William K Black, 2009:

Control (adjective) fraud:

"...the S&amp;P document demonstrates that the investment and commercial banks that purchased nonprime loans, pooled them to create financial derivatives, and sold them to others engaged in the same willful blindness. They did not review samples of loan files because doing so would have exposed the toxic nature of the assets they were buying and selling.

The entire business was premised on a massive lie -- that fraudulent, toxic nonprime mortgage loans were virtually risk-free. The lie was so blatant that the banks even pooled loans that were known in the trade as "liar's loans" and obtained AAA ratings despite FBI warnings that mortgage fraud was "epidemic."

The supposedly most financially sophisticated entities in the world -- in the core of their expertise, evaluating credit risk -- did not undertake the most basic and essential step to evaluate the most dangerous credit risk. They did not review the loan files. In the short and intermediate-term this optimized their accounting fraud but it was also certain to destroy the corporation if it purchased or retained significant nonprime paper. "

No, you didn't. You linked me to some articles (one of which says "read the other editorial" on a page with about 50 links) saying that illinois was tens of billions in debt and had tens of billions of pensions obligations (doesn't specify over how many years those will be paid out), and then added the figures in yourself. You then peppered this with a few examples, and left completely alone the issue of how much an average pension was or anything along those lines.

</quote>
Illinois state pensions are $85 billion underfunded right now, and that number is going up. We're already borrowing money to pay current retirees, even after huge tax increases.

<quote orig_author="stokes234">
I'm not purely partisan, if you can show me that average pensions in illinois are higher than elsewhere, or higher than can be argued fair or neccessary, i'll concede the point (that collective bargaining for pensions is badly handled in some situations, not that public sector unions are inherently a bad idea). But you haven't done that yet.

</quote>
The amounts really don't matter. What matters is that workers aren't paying enough to cover the cost, nor is the state. This leaves everyone else to make up the difference.

It was the political influence of unions that got the state to make deals they couldn;t keep. They knew it, the unions knew it. But they figure (probably correcty) that it will be Illinois taxpayers paying for their pensions. And frankly, the unions don't give a damn about how many elderly are thrown out of nursing homes to keep their pensions and health care coming, so why should anyone give adamn about them?

<quote orig_author="stokes234">
Then look around the world at the public pension funds that are being handled well. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/14/reality-check-public-sector-affordability">This</a> Grauniad page discusses future funding for UK public sector pensions - as a percentage of GDP, they are projected to fall, and that's before the tory contribution hikes are implemented (though I think after their retirement age hikes - bit cloudy).

We pay them to work 20 years, then they retire early and collect pensions and health care benefits for the next 30-40 years. Oh, and if they suck up to their boss or political patron maybe they get a fat raise the last week on the job, then guess what happens... their pension is based on the pay from that last raise! Never mind that they made no pension contributions based on that last raise. I think we have 3 retired state workers for every one working.

The demand for oil comes from where ? yep, consumers to fuel their vacation flights, fossil fuel powered toys like ATVs and dirt bikes, Their entertainment ( hey what's the fossil fuel consumption of say, a U2 concert, once you add it all up ? ) That' only a small part of the luxury/fun uses for oil. We could get into how warm and how big is your house if you want.

By linking the dollar to oil and making the dollar the de facto reserve currency of the world, Nixon enabled the US to indulge in decades of bubble blowing, creating the illusion of prosperity and facilitating the extraction of the country's wealth by "the 1%".

"President Obama, but for a handful of years and millions of dollars, is just as ignorant and foolish as those kids playing those damn drums in the street. The fact such a person was made President of theUnited States is more than a bit…troubling."

"...President Obama has little to do with controlling such a mob. He is simply a by-product of it. His jobs bill? (Shakes head) That move is nothing more than a feeble promise by the president that more money is on its way. To those unions. The first stimulus bill…what was that but a massive payback to his labor union masters? Keep those government checks coming. Those millions of government employees – the country has reached the tipping point there. To have a government so big, so vast, so powerful, so controlled now by organized labor. Labor whose leadership openly embraces socialism, Marxism, and any number of other –isms that all add up to anti-freedom. Anti-business. Anti-America. That is what is unfolding just down the street from us. The people engaged in it are silly and stupid. Ignorant and incapable. But the motives of the organizer behind these protests are very-very dangerous to the country. To each and every one of us. We are all in terrible danger here."

However, thanks for posting the interview, it was very entertaining, e.g.:

Ulsterman : What’s the remedy? How does the country go about…dealing with this threat?
WS Insider : Vote. Educate ourselves – and vote. It is the genius of our system – the simplest of remedies, and yet…we squander the opportunity in this country time and time again in favor of continued protection of self-interest, or giving in to more and more distraction....

Ulsterman : I didn’t vote for the man.
WS Insider : Your attempt to disqualify blame is not that simple.

Ulsterman : You just said voting was the simplest of remedies. Your words.
WS Insider : (Pause) Yes…
Ulsterman : I didn’t vote for the man. Did you?
WS Insider : No.
Ulsterman : No? You voted for McCain?
WS Insider : No – I didn’t vote. I haven’t voted for…for a very long time.
Ulsterman : Really? Why not? How can you sit here and say how genius our system of free elections are and then admit to not even participating?
WS Insider : I won’t offer up any excuse. No reasonable one exists. As I said, we are all guilty – we are all to blame for how the country has devolved into its current condition. Myself included.

Good advice, perhaps, to someone who wants to bring corporations to their knees. Since I highly doubt that's what the typical OWS'er wants, I call strawman again.

People can be unhappy with the way corporate America is today, and yet still buy from corporations the clothes they wear at the protests, without being inconsistent, hypocritical, or whatever it is you're criticizing them for.

No but they do enable you (and others) to purchase goods with money you don't (and may never) have! In fact if a good and/or service (let's say houses and tuition) becomes sufficiently financialized any change in bank lending standards (govt prompted or not) can lead to major demand and price distortion.

Gee I wonder if soaring tuition is an issue for some of these OWS protesters.. They need look no further than Wall Street and their pals at the DNC. At least they can see Wall Street from where they are, that's a good first step.

I'll let Chris Hedges respond to your naive plea [my bold]:

"Even now, three weeks later, elites, and their mouthpieces in the press, continue to puzzle over what people like Ketchup want. Where is the list of demands? Why don’t they present us with specific goals? Why can’t they articulate an agenda?

The goal to people like Ketchup is very, very clear. It can be articulated in one word—REBELLION. These protesters have not come to work within the system. They are not pleading with Congress for electoral reform. They know electoral politics is a farce and have found another way to be heard and exercise power. They have no faith, nor should they, in the political system or the two major political parties. They know the press will not amplify their voices, and so they created a press of their own. They know the economy serves the oligarchs, so they formed their own communal system. This movement is an effort to take our country back.

This is a goal the power elite cannot comprehend."

' <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-k-black/the-two-documents-everyon_b_169813.html">The Two Documents Everyone Should Read to Better Understand the Crisis</a> ', - William K Black, 2009:

Control (adjective) fraud:

"...the S&amp;P document demonstrates that the investment and commercial banks that purchased nonprime loans, pooled them to create financial derivatives, and sold them to others engaged in the same willful blindness. They did not review samples of loan files because doing so would have exposed the toxic nature of the assets they were buying and selling.

The entire business was premised on a massive lie -- that fraudulent, toxic nonprime mortgage loans were virtually risk-free. The lie was so blatant that the banks even pooled loans that were known in the trade as "liar's loans" and obtained AAA ratings despite FBI warnings that mortgage fraud was "epidemic."

The supposedly most financially sophisticated entities in the world -- in the core of their expertise, evaluating credit risk -- did not undertake the most basic and essential step to evaluate the most dangerous credit risk. They did not review the loan files. In the short and intermediate-term this optimized their accounting fraud but it was also certain to destroy the corporation if it purchased or retained significant nonprime paper. "

</quote>
Interesting, although not that relevant to what I said. It should be noted that your articles mention borrower fraud as well, which is also a big problem, and oddly enough, discuss people getting arrested for mortgage fraud despite the complaint earlier in the thread about how no one ever gets in trouble for this stuff.

I don't think you understand what the protest is about. People are not angry about the corporations being merely being wealthy. They are angry that corporations use that money to lobby their interest over people's interests.
So, in the light of what the movement is actually about, yes, my example does make sense -- and also because it's almost inevitable that people are going to own devices like phones with video capture capabilities, computers, etc.
Why should regular people have to sacrifice for something that is not their fault? That is shifting the responsibility to them.

Like I said in my previous post, the protest is not about eliminating corporations, it's about stopping them from using money as speech. Now do you get it? The people who started the protest were not angry about corporations being wealthy, just how they used the wealth in elections.

<quote>
At least eight Chicago labor leaders who are eligible for inflated city pensions also stand to receive union pensions covering the same work period, thanks to a charitable interpretation of state law by officials representing two city pension funds, a Tribune/WGN-TV investigation has found.

By double and even triple dipping on pensions, these union officials stand to reap millions more in retirement while thousands of rank-and-file union members face hard times and city pension funds stagger toward insolvency.

...One labor leader stands to reap more than $400,000 a year from three pensions — the city laborers fund, a union district council fund and a national union fund — all covering the same time period. During his expected lifetime, he stands to receive approximately $9 million, according to an analysis based on the funds' actuarial assumptions.

Union officials are accumulating these benefits even though the state pension code includes language aimed at preventing double dipping.

...Among those in line to reap multiple pensions with the blessing of city pension fund officials is Liberato "Al" Naimoli, president of Cement Workers Local 76.

Naimoli retired in 2010 from a $15,000-a-year city job that he hadn't worked at in a quarter-century. He now receives a city pension, based on his union salary, that pays him about $158,000 a year, more than any other annuitant in the city laborers' pension fund.

Like I said in my previous post, the protest is not about eliminating corporations, it's about stopping them from using money as speech. Now do you get it? The people who started the protest were not angry about corporations being wealthy, just how they used the wealth in elections.

I'm sure there are some people who are saying "END ALL CORPORATIONS!" at the protest, but that is not the premise it was started on.

Okay, do support these claims. Show me where the consensus of the protests throughout the US is about "using money as speech" and how the "corporations = evil therefore eliminate corporations" is not a dominate meme pervading the protests.

How do you know there wasn't any? I didn't look into this, but after reading that bozo's Rolling Stone article I looked into the lack of indictments about the Lehman Brothers and their Repo 105 accounting scheme. He had conveniently failed to mention that there had been several extensive investigations into it, but authorities believed that they would be unable to get any convictions.

Don't get me wrong, I am sure that there is plenty of banking fraud, in fact, I would be shocked if there was no banking fraud, but suspecting it and getting a conviction is two different things. The very nature of such crimes makes them very difficult to prove. And prosecuting cases that prosecutors know will lose would be extremely wasteful of taxpayer money.

When a locally based activist group came up with the idea of occupying Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, it wasn’t thinking about setting up camp on the Vancouver street that runs alongside the railway tracks.

Did you really think it wasn't about corporate influence in democracy? Why didn't you investigate yourself?

Like I said, I'm sure there are people who are there because they want all corporations to be dissolved, but that does not take away from what started it, and if you read my posts carefully, I did not say these people don't exist, in fact I acknowledged them.
Focusing more on the thread topic; the protest does remain to be hijacked by a political party or some other group.

So what if some people targeted millionaire homes? It still does not subtract from the original cause. At least they got media attention, which was probably the goal. Dealing with corporations is tricky, because they are not living people; they don't have homes, they don't have any of the needs that a person does, they have no human motivations, you cannot speak with them, etc. What you can do is speak with their shareholders. To say that this all of a sudden shifts the purpose of the protest to a class war is to misunderstand what is happening -- or pettifog.

If these people want to own some electronics, they can do so. Corporate corruption is not their fault. Owning a phone, computer, etc. in no way disqualifies them from criticizing or even being angry about corporate influence in politics. Yes, throwing away their beloved luxuries would be an unnecessary sacrifice, even if it does sound petty. Regarding the protests, this is irrelevant.
Anyway, if you are living in America, the lifestyle here almost demands some of these products -- at least a computer. Right now, college would be very difficult without a computer.

EDIT: Also, if you read my previous posts, you would see that I said I think the main problem is that they do not really have a solid demand. It seems like they are just angry about corporate corruption without a way to fix the problem. If they do not have a solid goal, then they won't accomplish much.

Still, entirely lacking in sources or detail. $85 billion per year? $85 billion over the next 60 years?

<quote orig_author="WildCat">
The amounts really don't matter. What matters is that workers aren't paying enough to cover the cost, nor is the state. This leaves everyone else to make up the difference.

</quote>
The amounts do matter. If you're paying an average pension to 1% of the state workforce after they retire, that's a very flimsy premise for blaming all of your economic woes on trade unions.

<quote orig_author="WildCat">
It was the political influence of unions that got the state to make deals they couldn;t keep. They knew it, the unions knew it. But they figure (probably correcty) that it will be Illinois taxpayers paying for their pensions. And frankly, the unions don't give a damn about how many elderly are thrown out of nursing homes to keep their pensions and health care coming, so why should anyone give a damn about them?

</quote>
Eh, I still need more details. If half of the trade union retirees are on $80k a year, that's serious business. If there are 3-4 examples of ex-leaders on $150k a year and then everyone else is on $8k a year, it's much harder to get angry about.

<quote orig_author="WildCat">
This is the USA politics section. And damn near every single public pension in the USA is underfunded. They certainly are in Illinois.

</quote>
Fair enough - though the examples I give show that when properly managed, and in the presence of often better organised and stronger trade unions elsewhere in the world, public pension funds are perfectly plausible. The similar claims of underfunding in the UK are partly the result of the current government making joining the public pension scheme far less attractive than it used to be, and as a result fewer people are paying into a system that relies on having a certain ratio of people paying in to those being paid out to. If you were having similar problems in the states it might explain the issues, but you're not giving much detail, you're just saying it's underfunded, everywhere else is underfunded, no time frame, no context, just a few examples of corruption sprinkled on top.

Honestly, I don't see what is so confusing about this. Your articles about the FBI saying there was an epidemic of fraud gave examples of lax underwriting allowing borrowers to make fraudulent claims. Good luck proving that the underwriters committed crimes and were not just incompetent. It doesn't matter if you think they deliberately aided borrowers in committing fraud or not, it has to be proven to get a conviction. Farther, you guys have alleged they sold loans under fraudulent premises. This definitely requires more information. If they were simply advertising investments under inaccurate high ratings from third parties you would have to prove that they bribed the ratings agencies to give poor investments AAA ratings to get a conviction for fraud. Essentially all of the allegations you guys are making could also be explained by incompetence, which makes prosecution very difficult. Prosecutors would have to demonstrate that the participants were not incompetent and were deliberately committing fraud to get convictions. The very nature of such crimes makes them difficult to prove.

And come on, seriously? On a skeptics forum you use a ridiculous conspiracy theory video as evidence? Are you going to cite Alex Jones next?

If they were simply advertising investments under inaccurate high ratings from third parties you would have to prove that they bribed the ratings agencies to give poor investments AAA ratings to get a conviction for fraud. Essentially all of the allegations you guys are making could also be explained by incompetence, which makes prosecution very difficult. Prosecutors would have to demonstrate that the participants were not incompetent and were deliberately committing fraud to get convictions. The very nature of such crimes makes them difficult to prove.

And come on, seriously? On a skeptics forum you use a ridiculous conspiracy theory video as evidence? Are you going to cite Alex Jones next?

This has already been discussed in this thread. There are investigations going on with this crap, but fraudulent acts were largely committed by third parties which provides a degree of protection to the bank employees that posters in this thread want locked up.

I hope they start by burning down the factories that make electronic voting machines and the warehouses where the state elections officials store them.

I think this is total nonsense. How can you solve a problem without having a solution to it? What do these Occupy Wall Street fools think they are going to accomplish? Do they really think they are going to protest in front of David Koch's home and he's suddenly going to have an epiphany and admit he was wrong all along?

Look at the civil rights protest/marches during the 1950s and 1960s, those folks had actual goals: end to segregation in the south and voting rights. Now look at these current day fools who declare "victory" because the city is still allowing them to sleep in their own feces.

The area around Zuccotti Park is a place where working folks live, they are kept up late by shouting and constant drum beating. Businesses in the area are hurting and the city is spending millions on police overtime. This is nothing but mob rule by a bunch of people that have no respect for private property or anyone living or working in that neighborhood.

If folks want to bring about change then stop sleeping on damp concreate and organize a voter registration campaign, fund raise for politicians that support your causes (heck, run yourself), lobby those currently in power. But in no way, shape or form is taking over a park and turning it into a mini "socialist paradise" going to change anything.

I fully understand how difficult a concept it is, buying corporate goods and the money trickling upstream to enrich the 1%, the enemy. But, hey, buy your camcorder, upload your protest footage to YouTube, link to it on facebook, the 1% won't mind at all.

Do you disagree that this is basically a "rich people suck " action ? If so why do you think there's so much attention paid to CEO's earnings ? Why do you suppose people actually care about the 1% and their 300 foot yachts ?

Here's another demand the protesters could make. Demand a course, at the high school level that deals strictly with money and debt. Make it required knowledge, that a credit cad isn't income, that that masters degree in fine arts won't land you a plum corporate job, that a house is not always an asset, that new car you buy depreciates at an alarming rate, that investing in the stock market is like going to Vegas and your favourite entertainers and sports stars might just be part of the 1%.

A very PETA like demand we stop slaughtering all the non human animals, peta is everyone's worst enemy as they take on reality is a bit shakey

abolishing all credit reporting agencies, people have credit scores for a reason, if only to give folks an incentive to pay their bills, as well as the blanket forgiveness of all debt, many of these folks got into debt through financial stupidity, some tough times would do them good.

It's a big problem with the come one come all format of this action. There never will be a one demand, it's a marketing ploy to get as many people as they can to bring their pet issues out ( yep, I went to a rally today ) and up the overall numbers.

All of those demands you cited above are from individuals or groups, I've seen others too, like a maximum wage.

I agree, a lot of debt is incurred on the spur of the moment, people living beyond their means, treating credit as income etc. I've done it myself. I like to call it, life plus 18% interest.

I don't know about the US, but in Canada a bank will only give you a mortgage based on 30 percent of your take home pay, less monthly commitments to outstanding debts. If interest rates spike and monthly payments go up, then the bank wont be stuck with a foreclosed property that may, or may not, have equity and may, or may not be in good repair.

If that's the message you want to deliver, then yes. But the 1 vs 99% is all about income, it's a demand for a more equitable income distribution. So how do we get there ? one way, the direct action way, would be to vote with your dollars.

No, just a whole lot of inconsistency on the part of the protesters.

It was pretty consistent today at the Occupy Seattle march I went to.

Here is a sample of the messages:

The banks were bailed out, we were sold out.
When the poor don't have any food they plan to eat the rich.
Move your money to a credit union on Nov 5th.
What does democracy look like? This is what democracy looks like.
The 99% are too big to fail.
I'll believe corporations are people when Texas executes one of them. (my favorite)

There were various complaints about the current status of student loans, anti-union activity, under taxed hedge fund profits, the under taxed 1%, money and lobbying corrupting our democratic process, and a smattering of Ron Paul supporters who think the federal reserve is to blame.

People attending were clearly from a very broad segment of the population.

The messages were very consistent and not at all the disorganized all over the map claim that the mainstream broadcast media is painting.

I think this is total nonsense. How can you solve a problem without having a solution to it? What do these Occupy Wall Street fools think they are going to accomplish? Do they really think they are going to protest in front of David Koch's home and he's suddenly going to have an epiphany and admit he was wrong all along?

Look at the civil rights protest/marches during the 1950s and 1960s, those folks had actual goals: end to segregation in the south and voting rights. Now look at these current day fools who declare "victory" because the city is still allowing them to sleep in their own feces.

The area around Zuccotti Park is a place where working folks live, they are kept up late by shouting and constant drum beating. Businesses in the area are hurting and the city is spending millions on police overtime. This is nothing but mob rule by a bunch of people that have no respect for private property or anyone living or working in that neighborhood.

If folks want to bring about change then stop sleeping on damp concreate and organize a voter registration campaign, fund raise for politicians that support your causes (heck, run yourself), lobby those currently in power. But in no way, shape or form is taking over a park and turning it into a mini "socialist paradise" going to change anything.

Where I was, the crowd was patronizing the local businesses. Occupying the park was a statement that we own the park, socialism had nothing to do with it.

Mass movements frequently alter the course of history. Whether the participants sleep on dry or damp concrete, march along slightly moist streets, or occupy very humid factories is totally irrelevant.

The cost of policing the ongoing demonstrations by Occupy Wall Street is mounting, according to Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.
Nearly a month after protesters took up residence at a park near Wall Street, Mr. Kelly said that overtime costs to police their activities and marches had hit nearly $2 million.
On Wednesday, word came that those costs had increased to $3.2 million. Where the final figure will land is anybody’s guess.

Nicole Carty, a member of the facilitation work group, said the city and the park owner were conducting a "tactical effort to evict us."
"The role [of maintaining the park] no longer belongs to them — it belongs to us," Carty said. "And we keep this park clean, and they no longer need to. We have liberated this space from them."

The mayor's comments came in response to a caller to his WOR Radio show who asked what the city intended to do about the protest headquarters in Zuccotti Park, which is near her apartment and where hundreds of people are camped out.

"What about my rights to use the park?" asked the caller, named Marsha.

"This is a little bit of greenery that we reclaimed after Sept. 11. It's not usable. There is a general sense of incivility down there. But worst of all are the drums and the shouting. I know they've agreed to stop the drumming. Last night they were drumming until 10:45. Someone did a little practice drumming this morning at 7:50."

Well, I've read the thread and haven't found it very useful. Maybe that's because I'm ignorant about economics. But so are many other Americans, and we all still have opinions. I think it's amazing and hopeful that such disparate elements have come together to show their unhappiness with how the country is functioning. I agree with <a href="http://occupywallst.org/about/">this quote from occupywallst.org</a> :
<quote>
Our nation, our species and our world are in crisis. The US has an important role to play in the solution, but we can no longer afford to let corporate greed and corrupt politics set the policies if [sic] our nation.

</quote>
And in my ignorance, I see the beginning of a solution. Regulation, oversight, and prosecution need to be increased. And just think, this will, as an added bonus, increase jobs all over the country. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Start by reversing all the deregulation since 1970, starting with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the 1980 deregulation of S&amp;Ls. Enact and enforce strict campaign reform laws that have teeth.

Change the tax laws to dramatically increase taxes on corporate profits over a certain (to be argued over and finally determined) level. Make sure profits are not wiped out by fancy accounting practices. Change the tax laws to dramatically increase taxes on bonuses (both monetary and in other forms) over a certain (to be argued over and finally determined) level. Pass the capital gains tax. Penalize investments (corporate and private) outside the United States. Penalize outsourcing. Simplify all other personal income taxes. Prohibit government employment contracts (at all levels, Federal, state, and local) from hiring someone for a short time and then letting them leave with full pension benefits.

That's my start. I only wish I had the power to convince the government to do these things.

And that's what I think unifies the Occupy Wall Street people. As has been said previously in this thread, their means may be different, but they all want to convince their representatives that something must be done about corporate greed and the ties between big money and government; that the present state of affairs is unsat and will not be tolerated much longer; that if some (unspecified, not agreed on) action is not taken, there will be consequences (also unspecified).

Also, bring back modified versions of the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps; our infrastructure could use some work and most state and local governments can't afford it. Money to fund the program could come from the new taxes on bonuses and excessive profits and the other tax changes mentioned above. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

It's not hard to find single examples to fit a particular narrative.

The park is public property and while i agree when individuals want to use public property for their personal benefit, that is not valid. But when the public wants to use public property, and that public is using it to respond to an unresponsive government, there is a difference. But as it is, the people who camped were willing to be arrested in order to be heard. And civil disobedience has been with us throughout historical times. It doesn't make the people who are speaking out bad people.

They can be bad, like when the white supremacists in the South broke laws to oppress blacks. I'm not claiming civil disobedience is always right. But when you have over 900 separate protests in over 80 countries, (or whatever the actual numbers were), it suggests people might just have a legitimate complaint.

Zuccotti Park in NYC where the occupiers have their headquarters is private property open to public use.

Here's an excerpt from a letter from the park's owner to the NYPD:

<quote>
Additionally, we have received hundreds of phone calls and e-mails from concerned citizens and office workers in the neighborhood. Complaints range from outrage over numerous laws being broken including but not limited to lewdness, groping, drinking and drug use, to the lack of safe access to and usage of the Park, to ongoing noise at all hours, to unsanitary conditions and to offensive odors. We have received complaints of harassment, one woman stating that she was verbally abused in front of her 5-year-old child and complaining that she had a package stolen from her as she tried to cross the Park.

It's not clear how much money the Bank Transfer Day will eventually involve. I don't have real high expectations. But I'll be happy if it is merely a noticeable amount.

Right now all the opinion polls show the public is on a different wavelength from the Congress. If the movement starts to chip away at that Congressional denial, that will be a success. It takes time.

I totally agree that a grass roots political movement takes a while to get off the ground but that's hard to do when a movement has no agenda, no leaders, no stated goals. Look what happened when the Zuccotti Park folks were trying to make a decision about garbage cans:

<quote>
The sanitation working group recently brought a simple proposal: the purchase of storage bins in order to tidy up the park. It passed, but only after a member of the assembly attached a friendly amendment stipulating that the bins should be certified Fair Trade. Unfortunately, when attempting to purchase Fair Trade storage bins, the sanitation committee discovered they do not exist. The proposal had to be passed again.

</quote>
These people seem more concerned about building a mini socialist paradise in the park then actually doing something about the problems facing the U.S. Did you know that in the 2010 mid-term elections New York State had the worst voter turnout rate in the entire country? Wouldn't a voter registration campaign be a more useful move then looking for fair trade garbage cans?

Zuccotti Park in NYC where the occupiers have their headquarters is private property open to public use.

Here's an excerpt from a letter from the park's owner to the NYPD:

While <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=John_E._Zuccotti">Zuccotti</a> seems like a reasonable corporate citizen, you are talking about an uber rich <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookfield_Properties">real estate developer</a>. Did you expect him to sympathize with a group protesting about too much wealth being concentrated at the top? I'm sure he and his corporate CEOs are annoyed. I'm not impressed.

There is a fundamentally different philosophical point of view here that makes it difficult for one side in the discussion to emphasize with the other. We might as well get that out in the open.

One side sees the rich taking as much as possible at the expense of the poor and middle class, including the working poor. It sees the rich using it's governmental influence that comes with that wealth to stack the deck. People lost their wealth and homes to foreclosure due to unscrupulous deceitful loan sharks. Banks gambled with pension funds and investors' money. The rich who gambled profited and everyone else who had no say in the matter lost. Government services benefit us all. If you shift those services to the private sector, people will be ripped off by the greed of that private sector.

The other side sees the rich 'creating' wealth, not taking it from others. It sees the rich as earning that wealth, not taking it using an unfair disadvantage. People lost their homes and wealth due to greed and their own stupidity. It's fair to pay workers less and less, they have the option of changing jobs. Government services are inefficient and the private sector can provide the services more efficiently, market forces would prevent the private sector from ripping people off for those services. Poor people want a free ride. They want the government to take care of them.

Perhaps this is the wrong thread for the above to be discussed. As it is these Wall St threads are muddled. I'll look for a better thread for this discussion and post a link here but I have to get some work done first.

I totally agree that a grass roots political movement takes a while to get off the ground but that's hard to do when a movement has no agenda, no leaders, no stated goals. Look what happened when the Zuccotti Park folks were trying to make a decision about garbage cans:

These people seem more concerned about building a mini socialist paradise in the park then actually doing something about the problems facing the U.S. Did you know that in the 2010 mid-term elections New York State had the worst voter turnout rate in the entire country? Wouldn't a voter registration campaign be a more useful move then looking for fair trade garbage cans?

Thousands of peaceful demonstrators began what some said would be a long-term occupation of cities across Canada Saturday, taking a stand against what they call corporate greed and economic inequality.

In Toronto, spontaneous chants of "we are the 99 per cent" broke out among demonstrators at the city’s St. James Park, a reference meant to distinguish protesters from "the elite one per cent" who control global wealth....

In Montreal, police said the occupation of Victoria Square by hundreds of protesters — with a generally festive tone, drumming and costumed dancers — was quiet.

“Everything is going well,” said Const. Daniel Lacoursiere,” of the Montreal police....

It's not about the owners of Zuccotti Park, it's about the people that work, live and go to school in that neighborhood. How is it fare that they have to be subjected to this mess? What does camping out in a park have to do with addressing problems in the U.S.? Go home and organize in your own communities.

As for everything else in your post, yes, you make good points. I don't however see the OWS crowd actually doing anything to address them.

' Think Occupy Wall St. is a phase? You don't get it '

" Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for most of the rest of us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns.

That's because, unlike a political campaign designed to get some person in office and then close up shop (as in the election of Obama), this is not a movement with a traditional narrative arc. As the product of the decentralized networked-era culture, it is less about victory than sustainability. It is not about one-pointedness, but inclusion and groping toward consensus. It is not like a book; it is like the Internet.

Occupy Wall Street is meant more as a way of life that spreads through contagion, creates as many questions as it answers, aims to force a reconsideration of the way the nation does business and offers hope to those of us who previously felt alone in our belief that the current economic system is broken.

But unlike a traditional protest, which identifies the enemy and fights for a particular solution, Occupy Wall Street just sits there talking with itself, debating its own worth, recognizing its internal inconsistencies and then continuing on as if this were some sort of new normal. It models a new collectivism, picking up on the sustainable protest village of the movement's Egyptian counterparts, with food, first aid, and a library. "

In my own cynical view they have already made their message quite clear.

"We are annoyed, we want you to do something about it."

The real problem is that without a clear message other than "Unrest" they are wide open to having others impose their narrative on them, anti-vaxers are already planning to exploit this as are the (un)usual suspects.

""" In their stand against mammon, protesters occupying St Paul's churchyard to vent anger at reckless bankers found heartwarming support emanating from the house of God.

Far from requesting that the 300-strong crowd be removed from the cathedral steps on Sunday, the Rev Dr Giles Fraser, canon chancellor of St Paul's, requested that the police themselves move on as the Occupy London Stock Exchange protest entered its second day.

A line of officers had taken up position at the top of the steps to "protect" the building. "Which was very good of them," explained the canon. But then he had asked them if they would leave, "because I didn't feel that it needed that sort of protection". """"

Now please provide evidence that "this is nothing but mob rule by a bunch of people that have no respect for private property or anyone living or working in that neighborhood", that the protestors are sleeping in their own feces and that protestors only complaint is "Hey, some people make too much money!".

While you're at it, please explain why the police have violently attacked non-violent protestors, share your suggestion about what you think protestors should do with their feces and urine and why you're so worried about them sleeping on damp concrete.

"""" I was recently asked what I thought the “one demand” should be for the OWS protest. That’s a tough question. I’ve seen many lists of the things people are suggesting. Most seem well intended. However, no one demand alone even begins to scratch the surface of what‘s wrong here. In fact, in a way, it points out how far we really are, from seeing where we really are. To sum it all up in one demand seemed impossible, so I decided to try. After much thought, I constructed the following analogy to describe my take on this whole One Demand issue.

Take a map and draw a circle, then say, everyone outside the circle is to have their labor and resources exploited for the benefit of those inside the circle. If you live outside the circle you say, “this system is completely ********** up.” If you live inside the circle you say, “this is capitalism and it’s the best system on earth you should try it it’s awesome. Sure, people outside are suffering, but who gives a **** about them?”

Now as the circle shrinks, as it is designed to do, concentrating accumulated wealth, people begin finding themselves suddenly outside of the circle. They jump up and down and cry foul, but the ones still in the circle say, “tough ****, you were too slow, shoulda run faster to stay inside the circle“. But then, they soon realize that they too are too slow to keep up with the rapidly shrinking circle, and quickly they find themselves left out, so they cry foul. “The system is broken!!!” they decry! But is it? Isn’t this the way the system has always functioned? Why is it now broken just because they, we, no longer reside within the bounds of its benefits?

We stand outside the ever shrinking circle, yelling fixes, throwing band-aids, making demands that the ever shrinking circle expand! at least big enough to include us so that we can go back to not giving a **** about the people outside, but alas, it will not. The circle does not expand, it does not know how. It only knows how to contract, concentrate, condense, like a dark star collapsing in on itself. There is no “demand” that will drag the borders of the circle back around us. And even if you could, would you? Would you go back to *********** the rest of the world to have your cable TV and your steel belted radials? I hope not. I hope the world is ready to say no more. No more. Therefore, since it is my sincere belief that the circle is/was and always will be ****** up, I say, surround them and demand that they collapse in on themselves and disappear into their own black hole.

That is my One Demand. """"

From the US Embassy in Damascus Facebook page;

<quote>
A Note from Facebook moderator Leslie Ordeman

We recently put up an article about the Occupy Wall Street protests in the USA -- there is lots of news about it on Syrian television stations.

For sure there is a lot of unhappiness in America about the economic situation. Unemployment is relatively high - nine percent. Housing prices keep falling, hurting more families. There is much debate between the two main American political parties about how to fix the U.S. economy.

We don't know exactly what will happen next. What we do know is:

* the US will have national elections in November 2012 that are not under the control of the American intelligence establishment but rather an independent election authority not controlled by the President or Congress;

* the Occupy Wall Street organizers will be entirely free to run as election candidates or to organize to support candidates;

* Occupy Wall Street groups will not be allowed to destroy public or private property, but they can organize more protests in other cities and they can say whatever they want about the U.S. government without being arrested or shot;

* the police will not shoot thousands of protesters;

* some Occupy Wall Street organizers have been arrested for disturbing public order (blocking traffic) but they won't be tortured, and no family will receive the body of a protester bearing torture marks.

* the international media and NGOs are watching and reporting on the Occupy Wall Street protests without interference from the government;

* the Occupy Wall Street organizers will be free to talk to any American or foreigner who wants to talk to them without fear of arrest;

* the U.S. government may complain that some countries' currency policies are hurting the U.S. economy, but the US government will not tell the world that there is a vague foreign conspiracy for which it lacks any specifics or evidence but that it says is encouraging the Occupy Wall Street or other protest movements.

Something to think about…

In the sense that more and more people are sitting around being mad at everything, but otherwise doing nothing proactive? Perhaps it is a premature conclusion - but from where in this static do you get the idea that something's going to change because of it?

"So you're mad at Wall Street. What are you going to do about it?"

"I'm going to stand here and hold this sign."

"And then what?"

"Nothing. That's what's so great about the movement! We're different!"

Hoooo....kay.

JihadJane's linked article comparing OWS with the Arab Spring is especially a howler, considering that the Arab Spring movements all have and had very specific demands.

OWS refuses to make specific demands not because of any principle, or as part of some singular "message" in and of itself, but rather because once the demands start getting made, the crowd starts to shrink as those who also "hate the 1%" but have different ideas of what to do about it start splitting off the "movement". Honestly, the attempts by individuals in the movement to spin this cowardly equivocation into "what makes the movement so strong" would be hilarious if they weren't so patronizing.

Charge the people responsible for lying about financial company assets and those who deceived borrowers with the crimes they've committed then send the guilty ones to jail Require the banks that got bailouts or who were involved in the dishonest housing loans to renegotiate loans down to the same price they could sell the foreclosed homes for instead of foreclosing and leaving the house abandoned and unsellable.

I'm of the belief it would take a carefully worded amendment to the Constitution to really remove the influence of money in government. I am not of the belief this is simple, easy or likely to actually occur. But by calling attention to the issue, I hope at least there could be a lessening of the influence of money at the federal level.

As for the right to lobby, sure, but there needs to be more daylight and less corruption in the process. It's one of those things that waxes and wanes throughout history and it is time for the pendulum to swing toward 'wane'.

By who? Who specifically committed what crimes? Here's a good explaination as to why there have been only 2 prosecutions:

<quote>
Prosecutors seem to have reached the same thought about the Wall Street honchos, concluding that they cant pin a crime even on such seemingly culpable figures as Joe Cassano (head of the AIGs derivatives business), Angelo Mozilo (whose Countrywide Lending mortgages were the embodiment of toxic loans) and Richard Fuld (the CEO of Lehman Brothers). Yes, there was plenty of intentional fraud in this crisis, notes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/business/economy/26nocera.html">Joe Nocera</a> in his New York Times column, but it happened streetside, between mortgage brokers and often naïve borrowers, not in the executive suite. The evidence, according to testimony in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission records, suggests that the white collar offenders Ferguson wants jailed were greedy, arrogant, inattentive, and oblivious. But not criminal.

</quote>
This isn't a recession and we're not getting out of it anytime soon. I don't mind if we raise taxes, especially capital gains, on millionaires but we can't grow debt, prices, or the size of the government forever at a faster pace than the growth of the underlying economy. We need to admit that economic growth over the last couple decades has not been enough to justify the growth in government spending, or in the costs of things like housing, health care and tuition. 2008 was just the tip of the icebubble. Toxic debt is still held at face value all through the economy, promises which cannot be kept have not yet been broken.

Insolvent entities, whether they're banks, borrowers, or students, need to be allowed to go bankrupt. Currently the government won't allow either banks or students to enter bankruptcy, and the banks are terrified to foreclose on the borrowers because if those properties hit the market home prices would fall to a level that reflects the organic home demand of people who actually have income/capital.

When we do this there will be an economic depression, don't freak out, default and bankruptcy are vital components of capitalism. We can't have capitalism only when it's "fun", the system can only be kept in balance if there are consequences for unwise decisions and unsustainable business models. The people who caused this haven't been allowed to suffer the capitalistic consequences of what they've done (and I'm not talking legal consequences this time), and the markets will remain uncertain, distorted, and distinctly un-capitalistic until that is done.

<quote>
Take the student loan programs back into the public sector and remove the profit skimming from the loans.

</quote>
I say make student loans dischargeable and don't federally backstop the lenders. These student loans/tuitions are as inflated as house prices ever were, colleges and lenders are getting rich gouging the government with the students as proxies (now also debt serfs thanks to government preventing bankruptcy).

This one really depends on whether we're really going to treat them like people, or give them the benefits of being people but not the drawbacks. One drawback to being a person is that when a person is caught doing something like laundering money for cartels or scamming their counterparties they can go to prison, their freedom to participate in society and the economy is often revoked for some period. If we were serious about corporate personhood, we'd revoke charters over behavior like that of Wachovia or Citi. We wouldn't need further proof, as organizations they were caught and admitted to the crimes. They got off with fines, which is not how we treat individual people at all. Fannie Mae hasn't even moved to cease robo-signing while negotiating the settlement for the last time they were caught.

The way we do corporate personhood reminds me more of Tron Carter from Dave Chappelle's Law &amp; Order sketch than the way actual "persons" are prosecuted:

*Warning, violence and offensive language ahead* (also assertions of systemic racism, while backed by statistical evidence, are OT so overlook that)

I already did earlier in the thread, Wachovia was caught laundering Mexican drug cartel money, Citi withheld material information about the contents of it's loans while selling MBS (we have sworn testimony that the higher-ups had been informed by 2007), Fannie and others are currently in settlement negotiations for document fraud (robo-signing). Let's start with that. We have three crimes, the facts of which are uncontroversial (even if as you say no specific individual can be tied to these acts), committed by corporations. In an effort to treat corporations like "people" I suggest that we revoke their charters, launch investigations to determine the amount of financial gain resulting from those crimes, then seize those ill-gotten gains before any assets are liquidated to bond and stock holders. Then maybe next time everyone involved will think twice.

We need banks and lending, but we don't need these specific criminal banks for the economy to function, so get rid of them.. completely. Get them "off the streets" so to speak.

How is this any different than a criminal charge against an individual? If you can't prove that someone is breaking the law the person is going to get away with it.

<quote orig_author="Wikipedia on vehicular homicide">
Vehicular homicide (also known as vehicular manslaughter) in most states in the United States, is a crime. In general, it involves death that results from the negligent operation of a vehicle, or more so a result from driving while committing an unlawful act that does not amount to a felony.

We know the laundering occured, we can't prove who knew about it but we can certainly decide who should have known and prosecute the entity for criminal recklessness.

Linking this didn't seem to help so I'll just quote it:

<quote orig_author="Wikipedia on willful blindness">
Willful blindness (sometimes called ignorance of law, willful ignorance or contrived ignorance or Nelsonian knowledge) is a term used in law to when an individual seeks to avoid civil or criminal liability for a wrongful act by intentionally putting himself in a position where he will be unaware of facts which would render him liable.

For example, in a number of cases, persons transporting packages containing illegal drugs have asserted that they never asked what the contents of the packages were and so lacked the requisite intent to break the law.

Such defences have not succeeded, as courts have been quick to determine that the defendant should have known what was in the package and exercised criminal recklessness by failing to find out.

</quote>
They say they had no idea it was drug money, but we know it WAS drug money. Wachovia either knew that or declined to find out. "I never looked in the bag I just took the money" doesn't fly with me and supposedly doesn't fly in our court system either. (edit) In other words if it's found that there are drugs or drug money in that bag, and you're holding that bag, you're in trouble. Supposedly.

This is one of those good things about capitalism, revoking the charter of a particular bank doesn't change the actual demand for banking services. Whoever steps in to provide the legitimate services Wachovia provided will need to employ people to do so. Having been one of the higher-ups at Wachovia may of course not look too good on a resume afterwards. Not buying this "load-bearing bank" defense, I see it as a mere variation on "they're too big to fail".

(edit)My central point here is that corporations have the same rights as individual citizens, but currently do not have the same responsibilities or criminal accountability that individual citizens have. My objection is to the latter, not the former, and it's largely the fault of the Executive branch. I realize I'm not attracting a lot of allies among partisans with this position.

Our former Governor Rod just happened to be one that got caught.

Even the idea of “taking back America” is a tried and true strategy for self-defeat: creating a fictive community that in reality includes conflicting interests and conflicting desires and will inevitably be directed by its most powerful elements.

<quote orig_author="The Guardian">
During a 22-month investigation by agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and others, it emerged that the cocaine smugglers had bought the plane with money they had laundered through one of the biggest banks in the United States: Wachovia, now part of the giant Wells Fargo.

The authorities uncovered billions of dollars in wire transfers, traveller's cheques and cash shipments through Mexican exchanges into Wachovia accounts. Wachovia was put under immediate investigation for failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering programme. Of special significance was that the period concerned began in 2004, which coincided with the first escalation of violence along the US-Mexico border that ignited the current drugs war.

Criminal proceedings were brought against Wachovia, though not against any individual, but the case never came to court. In March 2010, Wachovia settled the biggest action brought under the US bank secrecy act, through the US district court in Miami. Now that the year's "deferred prosecution" has expired, the bank is in effect in the clear. It paid federal authorities $110m in forfeiture, for allowing transactions later proved to be connected to drug smuggling, and incurred a $50m fine for failing to monitor cash used to ship 22 tons of cocaine.

More shocking, and more important, the bank was sanctioned for failing to apply the proper anti-laundering strictures to the transfer of $378.4bn – a sum equivalent to one-third of Mexico's gross national product – into dollar accounts from so-called casas de cambio (CDCs) in Mexico, currency exchange houses with which the bank did business.

"Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations," said Jeffrey Sloman, the federal prosecutor. Yet the total fine was less than 2% of the bank's $12.3bn profit for 2009.

We're talking about $378 billion in transfers here. Now, I don't know what the budget of your average narco-terrorist army is, but with negligence that big I don't care. The worst-case scenarios get pretty awful. We can hope Wachovia wasn't enabling most of the financing for these murderers (they easily could have been with those figures), but hope is all we can do now. If you think a couple hundred million in fines is an appropriate or meaningful response or will deter others from these same activities I will have no further motive to discuss this with you. Our worldviews would at that point be mutually exclusive and I'll have no choice but "agree to disagree".

(edit)This entire conversation has been about one of many things I said in response to Skeptic_Ginger on the previous page. I may have reached the end of my rope on this matter, but will try and stop by tomorrow to see if anything else I've said is responded to.

We're talking about $378 billion in transfers here. Now, I don't know what the budget of your average narco-terrorist army is, but with negligence that big I don't care. The worst-case scenarios get pretty awful. We can hope Wachovia wasn't enabling most of the financing for these murderers (they easily could have been with those figures), but hope is all we can do now. If you think a couple hundred million in fines is an appropriate or meaningful response or will deter others from these same activities I will have no further motive to discuss this with you. Our worldviews would at that point be mutually exclusive and I'll have no choice but "agree to disagree".

Getting back to the Occupy A Park That Isn't On Wall Street folks, I can across this <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/the99percentdeclaration/home">99% Declaration</a> ; not sure if it's official, but worth discussing.

Essential elements of the plan are as follows:

1. National convention to take place starting July 4, 2012 in Philly. Two delegates (one male, one female) to be elected from each congressional district. The delegates will come up with a Petition of Grievances, which they will submit to the Congress.

2. If the grievances are not acted upon to their satisfaction, they will form a third party and run in all 435 congressional districts in 2014.

There is a long list of proposed grievances, but none are binding as yet; they are just includedin the declaration as samples.

More <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/the99percentdeclaration/home/the-steps-to-non-violent-revolution">info here</a>.

Observations: Essentially they plan to do nothing for the next two years or so; what a shock! The third-party threat is silly, particularly as it is focused on the House of Representatives. I do like this proposal:

Because these fools don't even know what they are talking about. The link below shows a protestor this weekend holding a sign that says, "Chase, give us our money back". Ummm.....Chase repaid the TARP money (with interest) over two years ago! How can problems be solved if people are too ignorant to even try to figure out what they are?

<a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/15/141382468/occupy-wall-street-inspires-worldwide-protests">http://www.npr.org/2011/10/15/141382...dwide-protests</a>

</quote>
Teach-ins and discussion is largely what the Occupy movement is about, e.g. : ' Do you idiots realize that Chase paid back every penny of bailout money plus $800MM in interest? ', <a href="http://occupywallst.org/forum/do-you-idiots-realize-that-chase-paid-back-every-p/">http://occupywallst.org/forum/do-you...-back-every-p/</a>

Propagandistic name-calling might increase tumescence but it doesn't make you right or guarantee that the same labels cannot be applied to you.

Chase may well have paid back part of a gift that it didn't need in the first place. Other banks and insurance companies haven't. Chase's TARP money windfall was a tiny amount when compared to its supposed assets but the taxpayer still foots the bill, even now it's "paid back". It used the money to enrich and expand itself rather than ease lending and returned it via parasitic financial shuffling games, giving nothing back to the economy.

More importantly, the banks received other bailouts and subsidies which they (including Chase) will likely never pay back (details in first article linked to, below)

""" When all of the different bailouts and subsidies given to the big banks are added up, it is obvious that they have not come anywhere close to "paying back" what we gave to them. """

' <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/no-big-banks-have-not-paid-back-government-bailouts-and-subsidies">No, The Big Banks Have Not "Paid Back" Government Bailouts and Subsidies</a> '

""" Here's the thing: Even today, CNBC is still talking about "recapitalizing the banks." What's "recapitalize" mean? It means steal from you. See, the reason you need to "recapitalize" these firms is that they*********** away their own capital by doing dangerous, risky, even fraudulent things. """

<quote>
The protesters have a distinct ideology and are bound by a deep commitment to radical left-wing policies. On Oct. 10 and 11, Arielle Alter Confino, a senior researcher at my polling firm, interviewed nearly 200 protesters in New York's Zuccotti Park. Our findings probably represent the first systematic random sample of Occupy Wall Street opinion.

Our research shows clearly that the movement doesn't represent unemployed America and is not ideologically diverse. Rather, it comprises an unrepresentative segment of the electorate that believes in radical redistribution of wealth, civil disobedience and, in some instances, violence. Half (52%) have participated in a political movement before, virtually all (98%) say they would support civil disobedience to achieve their goals, and nearly one-third (31%) would support violence to advance their agenda.

<quote>
Stealing is our biggest problem at the moment, said Nan Terrie, 18, a kitchen and legal-team volunteer from Fort Lauderdale.

I had my Mac stolen -- that was like $5,500. Every night, something else is gone. Last night, our entire [kitchen] budget for the day was stolen, so the first thing I had to do was... get the message out to our supporters that we needed food!

Crafty cat burglars sneaked into the makeshift kitchen at Zuccotti Park overnight and swiped as much as $2,500 in donated greenbacks from right under the noses of volunteers whod fallen asleep after a long day whipping up meals for the hundreds of hungry protesters, the volunteers said.

Getting back to the Occupy A Park That Isn't On Wall Street folks, I can across this <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/the99percentdeclaration/home">99% Declaration</a> ; not sure if it's official, but worth discussing.

Essential elements of the plan are as follows:

1. National convention to take place starting July 4, 2012 in Philly. Two delegates (one male, one female) to be elected from each congressional district. The delegates will come up with a Petition of Grievances, which they will submit to the Congress.

It's an interesting concept in toto, but I'm afraid I can never support it since they require "delegates" to be of a certain gender. What were they thinking when they slipped that in there?

Occupy Wall Street protesters said yesterday that packs of brazen crooks within their ranks have been robbing their fellow demonstrators blind, making off with pricey cameras, phones and laptops -- and even a hefty bundle of donated cash and food.

“Stealing is our biggest problem at the moment,” said Nan Terrie, 18, a kitchen and legal-team volunteer from Fort Lauderdale.

“I had my Mac stolen -- that was like $5,500. Every night, something else is gone. Last night, our entire [kitchen] budget for the day was stolen, so the first thing I had to do was... get the message out to our supporters that we needed food!”

Crafty cat burglars sneaked into the makeshift kitchen at Zuccotti Park overnight and swiped as much as $2,500 in donated greenbacks from right under the noses of volunteers who’d fallen asleep after a long day whipping up meals for the hundreds of hungry protesters, the volunteers said.

I got asked what I think about OWS.

It's fantastic that these people are politically active and aren't plagued by a general apathy that is expected of most of the public, but how could I actually support the movement? It seems like a straggling throng of discontented people who seem to share a general frustration with monetary stuff.

I don't despise it though, they have a lot to justify their ire. I appreciate their frustrations, but it's too fragmented a movement with no unified momentum for me to really understand at this point.

That the 1st Amendment does not apply to corporations isn't just one argument against the Citizens United decision, it's pretty much the only one I've ever heard.

Go ahead, find an argument against it that doesn't stem from the claim that corporations have no 1st Amendment rights. In fact, it's what the government lawyers argued at the oral arguments before the SCOTUS.

What do you mean, "who is going to disclaim them"? This is a movement, is it not? How can it be so that everyone agrees "in one voice" without need of a King of OWS that banks are evil and bad and that's okay, but as soon as anybody points at somebody and says "this loon's with you guys?" it's all a bunch of hem-hawing about not having standards being the point? Obviously somebody who goes to the protest waving a sign saying something like "banks keep our nation from collapsing", while his physical presence may be tolerated, is not going to be embraced and made to feel part of OWS. Right or wrong? So what's the difference? Why can't you point at a loon who defecates on a cop car and agree, "in one voice", that's not right, just like you agree about banks?

It's because even if it's not a majority there's still a significant number of people in your movement who feel it's perfectly acceptable, and you know that, and if the movement disclaimed that attitude, the "huge protest" would suddenly become smaller by an appreciable number. It's not "confirmation bias".

And that excuses an unconstitutional restriction of free speech... how? Because last time I checked, the first amendment didn't have a clause allowing for exceptions if the majority is "concerned". In fact, the entire premise of the bill of rights is to protect rights against the majority. Your casual disregard for such liberal principles is disappointing, but not surprising.

Plus, of course, your own logic is internally inconsistent. If a large majority is really against such speech, then how is it that this speech can manage to win elections?

That the 1st Amendment does not apply to corporations isn't just one argument against the Citizens United decision, it's pretty much the only one I've ever heard.

Go ahead, find an argument against it that doesn't stem from the claim that corporations have no 1st Amendment rights. In fact, it's what the government lawyers argued at the oral arguments before the SCOTUS.

Are you claiming that freedom of speech only applies to individuals, but freedom of the press applies to both individuals and corporations? They are, for all practical purposes, the same thing.

Do you understand what the word "press" means in the Constitution? It means a printing press, to make it clear that not only is spoken speech protected under the 1st Amendment but also printed speech. This has been subsequently extended to broadcast speech, digitally transmitted speech, recorded speech, etc. The word "press" in the Constitution was not synonymous with "news media", though news media certainly enjoys freedom of the press.

Brief Amicus Curiae of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Support of Appellant

...Conclusion

Many editors would choose not to run the type of commentary seen in Hillary: The Movie for a variety of reasons – its political viewpoint, its length, or its tone, for example. These editorial decisions, though, cannot create legally meaningful distinctions without forcing the courts to “sit as superior editors of the press.” See Shulman v. Group W Productions, Inc., 18 Cal. 4th 200, 229 (1998).

Justice Thomas in McConnell warned of the risk that overbroad campaign finance regulations pose to the news media, saying that would-be censors of the press “need only argue that the press ‘capacity to manipulate popular opinion’ gives rise to an ‘appearance of corruption,’” and that “laws regulating media outlets in their issuance of editorials would be upheld under the” Court’s opinion in McConnell. 540 U.S. at 285 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court below has made this a reality, directly suppressing the type of political commentary that has long been the right and responsibility of the news media. For this reason, that application of the BCRA to Hillary: The Movie is an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment’s protection for freedom of speech and of the press.

The crowd of about 200 seemed evenly divided between lower Manhattan residents demanding an end game to the demonstrations and protesters vowing to fight for as long as it takes for <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Wall+Street">Wall Street</a> greed to end.
"They are defecating on our doorsteps," griped <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Katherine+Hughes">Katherine Hughes</a>, a mom who lives a block from Zuccotti Park.

The problem is they won't disown anyone. The local community board came to them with a very reasonable request: cut the drumming down from 10 hours a day to 2 hours a day. They can't even achieve that so how can anyone expect them to do anything about Wall Street?

As the communal sleeping bag argument between Lauren Digion and Sage Roberts threatened to get out of hand, a facilitator in a red hat walked by, brow furrowed. Remember? Youre not allowed to do any more interviews, he said to Digion. She nodded and went back to work. But when Roberts shouted, Dont tell me what to do! Digion couldn't hold back.

Someone has to be told what to do," she said. "Someone needs to give orders. Theres no sense of order in this ******* place.

When the "general assembly" cracked down on the unending drumming and it limited to 2 hours per day, Shane Engelerdt, a 19-year-old from Jersey City and self-described former head drummer, said, They are becoming the government were trying to protest" he said. "They didnt even give the drummers a say... Drumming is the heartbeat of this movement. Look around: This is dead, you need a pulse to keep something alive. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

<quote>
The drummers claim that the finance working group even levied a percussion tax of sorts, taking up to half of the $150-300 a day that the drum circle was receiving in tips. Now they have over $500,000 from all sorts of places, said Engelerdt. Were like, whats going on here?

In the western world, there's also the option of opting out as well. I mean, didn't these activists realise there was a "problem" with the banking system after watching Zeitgeist ? These guys are as addicted to modern conveniences just as much as joe average. I was in line behind a couple of these protesters in 711 a couple of days ago and they were buying their junk food with cards.

So, occupy Vancouver has decided to deviate from the official occupy script and came to the consensus that only a 90% consensus is needed to pass a motion. it appears that the direct democracy ( read anarchist ) model of government is proving unwieldy.

Our local occupy organizer was on facebook whining about how he doesn't want to be on welfare, it's not his fault. I can only wonder if he's putting the same effort into his job search as he is into updating that facebook/youtube/flickr/livestream page.

The city of Vancouver claims to have spent half a million dollars on policing last week. They're citing the Stanley Cup riots as the need for this level of security however IMO this is a mistake. They should have mentioned the 2010 anti-Olympics protests instead when, one Saturday morning a group of activists did go all smashy smashy.

As far as I can tell, the main concern these activists have is the level of media coverage they're getting. Hey look! I'm on TV!

Attempts to draw the conversation into some sort of rational discussion is not really representative of what they are doing. We all know they are mad, about something and everything. Most are there to just be part of some sort of perceived potential revolution or some sentimental/nostalgic protest scene. Serious political action, not so much.

With the lack of anti-Bush/anti-War events there has been a built up demand for something to rally against. Since they are mostly left leaning, protesting against BO is out, even though he is a top recipient of Wall street money. Wall street has filled that void.

Doesn't it seem they are angry with the wrong people then? Shouldn't it be Occupy Washington D.C.? Certainly actual cases of criminal wrongdoing should be investigated and prosecuted although it seems most claims in this regard are very vague, but banks, investment firms etc can hardly be blamed for pursuing their own interests when they play by the rules. And stripping shareholders (and union members) of their right to free speech because they have the nerve to belong to organizations that pool resources is hardly the answer. If people are upset about the cozy relationship between some businesses and politicians they should be demanding a better class of politicians. We should expect that business employees work for their employer and we should expect that politicians work for us as we are their employer.

(Note-as disgusting as it may seem, the government was probably right to bail out banks and financial firms, as bad as the economy is now, throughout modern history, the difference between a recession and a depression is generally widespread banking collapses, things would be much worse had that happened despite what Ron Paul fans think.)

BUT DAMN IT, REGULATE. That's what we used to do. That's what Canada does and they don't have this kind of @#$%.

Look, this isn't hard. It's not mysterious. We know what to do. We figured most of it out during the depression. We passed laws that kept our financial entities largely healthy and competitive. The Canadians and other nations know what to do. We don't do it because our elected leaders are in the pockets of the corporations pure and simple.

I didn't say it was your argument, I just addressed it as it has come in this thread a lot. Demanding transparency is one thing, demanding that people be denied the right to participate in the political process because they are better at lobbying is a whole other issue. And certainly demanding that it is okay for the government to ban documentaries, books etc when corporate money is involved takes that to a whole other level of censorship. Wildcat is quite right that most, if not all, people opposed to the Citizen's United ruling have no idea what it was about.

To be perfectly frank, people who lost their homes did not pay their debts back. It is a common criticism that lenders gave loans they should have known wouldn't likely be paid back, and it is clearly a valid one, but it doesn't also follow to complain that people who couldn't pay back their mortgages lost the collateral. People who lost investments may have a more valid complaint depending what the investment was, but they all come with risk. If a lack of lending now has cost you your job you wouldn't have had the job without the lending in the first place.

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that nothing wrong happened, I am saying that many people hurt are themselves partially to blame. It may feel nice to blame the sub prime lender who gave you a mortgage for your home loss after you lied to them about your income and they did a poor underwriting job and didn't discover that. It may feel fantastic to blame the bank for not lending you money to keep your business afloat even though no one made you start up with less capital in reserve. Blaming the ratings agencies for being inaccurate on derivatives may feel great but no one made you listen to them (I'm not saying you did these things, just putting them up as hypothetical scenarios, albeit, ones that have played out a lot). Wall Street screwed up a lot, but they are hardly alone in that.

Again, this was discussed earlier in the thread, his claims that multiple government agencies actively conspire with Wall Street and/or all government employees are too stupid to ever catch an employee on Wall Street breaking the law weren't compelling then. As previously discussed, he also conveniently failed to mention actual investigations into the criminal activities he alleges. For instance, he whines that no one at Lehman Brothers went to prison for the Repo 105 accounting business but fails to mention that there were several investigations into it and government agencies felt that they could not prove a case of fraud in court. And again, as discussed previously, it is a monumental challenge to prove fraud when incompetence could just as easily be the explanation. His whining about conspiracies and how the typical FBI agent is too dumb to balance a checkbook was hardly necessary to account for what has actually gone on. Fraud was likely but rarely prosecuted due to the nature of said fraud. Interestingly enough, the way this came up earlier in the thread was also people claiming that no one has gone to prison for assorted illegal banking activities, yet they posted link after link that talked about people being locked up for assorted illegal banking activities.

Agreed to an extent, but it is that many lenders didn't adequately investigate that the answers to the questions they asked were accurate. My first job out of college was at a place that lent out mortgages, the specifics can stay anonymous on a message board, it is sufficient to say that they only lent to people likely to pay back (good credit, low loan to value etc) and probably more than 95% of applicants had blatantly fraudulent information on their loan applications, whether they wanted an original loan or to refinance they lied constantly, this place did sufficient underwriting to weed them out but we constantly lost salesmen to places who did little to no underwriting because they could earn more commissions at those places.

To be clear, that wouldn't have happened without the absurd overestimates of mortgage backed securities. Virtually all lenders participate in secondary markets, many banks will not give, and have never given, subprime loans, but they will buy them in secondary markets. The mortgage industry has secondary markets on top of secondary markets with the securities and derivatives. For the most part, this is the area that many big financial players got themselves in trouble in. Without the secondary markets the subprime lenders would quickly be out of money, if they can't sell the loans, they quickly run out of capital to make new loans. When the **** hit the fan it wasn't generally that banks held bad mortgages, it was that they held bad securities based off of those mortgages and couldn't sell them anymore as there was no buyers, the capital invested was dead and they were overleveraged.

You buy the common narrative, the borrowers were aware of what they were getting. But the reality is quite different in many cases.

<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/white_collar/mortgage-fraud/mortgage_fraud">FBI report on Mortgage Fraud</a>
From the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/financial-crimes-report-2009/financial-crimes-report-2009#mortgage">Overview:</a>
<quote>
In 2009, the continuing deterioration of the real estate market and the dramatic rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures helped fuel the financial crisis and exposed fraudulent practices that were prevalent throughout the mortgage industry....

...Mortgage fraud schemes employ some type of material misstatement,
misrepresentation, or omission relating to the property or potential borrower which is relied on by an underwriter or lender to fund, purchase, or insure a loan. These misstatements, misrepresentations, or omissions are indicative of mortgage fraud and include the following:

Inflated Appraisals
Fictitious/Stolen Identities
Nominee/Straw Buyers
False Loan Application
Fraudulent Supporting Loan Documentation
Kickbacks

Although there are many different types of schemes, mortgage fraud can be summarized as a form of bank robbery where the bank is not even aware it has been robbed until months or years later. Mortgage fraud perpetrators often obtain loans based on falsely representing the value of the collateral or their qualifications to receive the loan and steal the proceeds without an intention of repaying the borrowed funds. Lending institutions are subsequently left holding the inflated collateral and incurring significant losses.

</quote>
First, one has to ask, why weren't the banks aware of what they were getting?

While that sounds like the borrowers were the deceivers, it was in fact, the brokers and they deceived the borrowers as well as the lenders. Borrowers can indeed be responsible, but they are not always:
<quote>
Current investigations and widespread reporting indicate a high percentage of mortgage fraud involves collusion by industry insiders, such as appraisers, mortgage brokers, attorneys, loan originators, and other professionals engaged in the industry. Fraud for Housing typically represents illegal actions conducted solely by the borrower, who is motivated to acquire and maintain ownership of a house under false pretenses such as misrepresented income and asset information on a loan application.

</quote>
If the fraudulent broker sends you an appraiser who tells you your house if worth more when it is really worth less the borrower can be misled. A balloon payment or a sharp increase in the rate was hidden from some borrowers. You trust the broker is giving you an honest summary of the loan papers. I've purchased 3 homes and refinanced numerous times. I trusted the brokers to be honest. I read the papers but it is easy to miss something in pages of fine print of legalese.

Some borrowers were literally deceived. It wasn't all about greedy borrowers seeking more credit than they could afford.

That was great. Thanks for sharing.

Real estate losses depend on the location. I bought my current house in 1991 for $162,000 and invested $99,000 over the years adding on and remodeling. If I sold now I'd probably get $500,000 at the low end and maybe more considering the house backs to over <a href="http://www.bellevuewa.gov/willburton.htm">100 acres of woods</a> and next to that is a <a href="http://www.bellevuewa.gov/botanical_garden.htm">53 acre botanical garden</a>. I'm about 2 miles as the crow flies from the city center. But if I bought this house 5 years ago, it would have cost over $800,000 and I'd be down a considerable amount in equity.

CA real estate has been way up and way down over the same period of time. It depends where you live and when you bought.

This came up before and I bowed out. It's too much work to document the facts. The execs in the biggest financial institutions knew full well they were playing a shell game with asset reports and the big auditor companies were involved and aware.The federal government (aka the Obama admin) has so far refused to investigate. The claim has been made that is because no laws were in place preventing the behavior. Ayn Rand idoler Greenspan pushed to let the markets self regulate and then admitted to being shocked it didn't work the way he thought it would.

However, some states attorneys general are taking action and pursuing the criminal charges the Federal Justice Department is ignoring. Only time will sort this out.

The experiences of fraud investigator, Eileen Foster, give a flavor of what will be uncovered if any comprehensive investigations are ever allowed to happen (it would be a massive undertaking).

"""... the investigators were able to uncover what they believed was evidence that branch employees had used scissors, tape and Wite-Out to create fake bank statements, inflated property appraisals and other phony paperwork. Inside the heaps of paper, for example, they found mock-ups that indicated to investigators that workers had, as a matter of routine, literally cut and pasted the address for one home onto an appraisal for a completely different piece of property.

...

By early 2008, she claims, she’d concluded that many in Countrywide’s chain of command were working to cover up massive fraud within the company — outing and then firing whistleblowers who tried to report forgery and other misconduct. People who spoke up, she says, were “taken out.”

By the fall of 2008, she was out of a job too. Countrywide’s new owner, Bank of America Corp., told her it was firing her for “unprofessional conduct.” """

According to Douglass Schoen the protests are mostly made up of the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204479504576637082965745362.html">various ideological factions of the hard left:</a>

<quote>
The protesters have a distinct ideology and are bound by a deep commitment to radical left-wing policies. On Oct. 10 and 11, Arielle Alter Confino, a senior researcher at my polling firm, interviewed nearly 200 protesters in New York's Zuccotti Park. Our findings probably represent the first systematic random sample of Occupy Wall Street opinion.

Our research shows clearly that the movement doesn't represent unemployed America and is not ideologically diverse. Rather, it comprises an unrepresentative segment of the electorate that believes in radical redistribution of wealth, civil disobedience and, in some instances, violence. Half (52%) have participated in a political movement before, virtually all (98%) say they would support civil disobedience to achieve their goals, and nearly one-third (31%) would support violence to advance their agenda.

The vast majority of demonstrators are actually employed, and the proportion of protesters unemployed (15%) is within single digits of the national unemployment rate (9.1%).

An overwhelming majority of demonstrators supported Barack Obama in 2008. Now 51% disapprove of the president while 44% approve, and only 48% say they will vote to re-elect him in 2012, while at least a quarter won't vote.

Fewer than one in three (32%) call themselves Democrats, while roughly the same proportion (33%) say they aren't represented by any political party.

What binds a large majority of the protesters together—regardless of age, socioeconomic status or education—is a deep commitment to left-wing policies: opposition to free-market capitalism and support for radical redistribution of wealth, intense regulation of the private sector, and protectionist policies to keep American jobs from going overseas.

OWS refuses to define itself. Anyone and everyone who comes along is pointedly accepted as long as they are "mad at wall street"; literally nothing else matters - including, oddly enough, income, since millionaire film industry icons are celebrated there. It makes no sense to accuse those who point out the crack pots as employing "confirmation bias" because the crack pots are explicitly encouraged to participate in OWS just as much as any "non" crack pot.

Uh, no. That was a challenge to support a claim that somebody should be prosecuted. But unless you're advocating discarding the rule of law, then the only way (and the only reason) to charge someone with a crime is if they broke the law. So the burden of proof is on those who actually want anyone prosecuted to support their claim. Which... hasn't happened.

So you're wrong. Demanding that someone support their claims is not an argument from ignorance.

"Myth #7. The Labor Unions Are Behind This.

I saw only one labor union table at the demonstration, but most of the people seemed to have no connection to organized labor. Even if they had, there's nothing wrong with that. Labor unions are an important part of our country, and while not perfect, they've helped throughout history to improve working conditions for millions of Americans."

That's his analysis? It didn't look like unions were heavily involved?

No attempt to figure out how much money unions are spending on this? No attempt to figure out how much union personnel might be working behind the scenes? No attempt to figure out if union organizers have taken on "non-union" leadership roles within the protest?

One wonders why he bothered to "debunk" this myth when he has so little to debunk it with. Especially since he argues that it wouldn't matter even if the "myth" were true. I guess "9 myths" doesn't sound as nice as "10 myths".

What is that people don't get? There was a movement, People called their friends and said let's do something so they protested Wall Street. Word got out and more and more people showed up. This isn't difficult.
It's been more than 10 years of a lousy economy. Every year most middle class and poor must live on less and less while the rich get richer. Many people who graduate from college can't get jobs. WALL STREET @#$%ed US and drove our economy further into the ditch. Have you looked at the GDP adjusted for inflation compared to 10 years ago? Have you looked at the stock market lately compared to 10 years ago?

Things are getting worse and worse and people are sick and tired about it. What's so difficult about that?

Occupy Wall Streets Finance Committee has nearly $500,000 in the bank, and donations continue to pour in -- but its reluctance to share the wealth with other protesters is fraying tempers.

Some drummers -- incensed they got no money to replace or safeguard their drums after a midnight vandal destroyed their instruments Wednesday -- are threatening to splinter off.

F--k Finance. I hope Mayor Bloomberg gets an injunction and demands to see the movements books. We need to know how much money we really have and where its going, said a frustrated Bryan Smith, 45, who joined OWS in Lower Manhattan nearly three weeks ago from Los Angeles, where he works in TV production.

But we're still missing information in order to judge the investment. How much did she put down on the house? If she put down 100% then your argument is reasonable; after inflation, she lost money on the house. If she put down $20,000 (a pretty sizable down payment) then she probably broke even or came out ahead on the deal. A higher down payment and she lost money after inflation; a lower down payment and she made money.

More important in my mind is that her story is hardly a heart-wrencher compared to the millions of people who bought in 2003-2008, who really, really lost money, not even considering inflation. There have been many cases where people lost money on paper because they didn't sell at the top of the market; my parents sold their home in 1999 for $250,000; about three years earlier it would have been worth $400,000. And this was during those golden Clinton years you remember.

Our research shows clearly that the movement doesn't represent unemployed America and is not ideologically diverse. Rather, it comprises an unrepresentative segment of the electorate that believes in radical redistribution of wealth, civil disobedience and, in some instances, violence. Half (52%) have participated in a political movement before, virtually all (98%) say they would support civil disobedience to achieve their goals, and nearly one-third (31%) would support violence to advance their agenda.

Your links aren't peer reviewed either. I'm not sure when I've seen a public opinion poll that was, nor do I see any reason to submit such a poll for peer review.

That's true. I bought in 2000, then was completely baffled to see resale prices double in this very modest neighborhood. I also feel bad for people saddled with those mortgages. But that doesn't really make the case against banks any less compelling. Questionable loans bundled together helped feed the speculative bubble and the overbuilding wasn't the fault of individuals. Everyone could have been more prudent including Americans who considered their homes their piggy banks, however the financial sector's actions obliterated any chance of a "soft landing."

The left-wing small-c communists are by definition at one end of the spectrum. The other seems to be "every man for himself," period. If people start tilting left because the right wing seems so callous I see that as a natural correction in an extreme environment. It may be why OWS has people sticking up for it. Lyndon Johnson was smart enough to understand a coming groundswell of opinion against the Vietnam War even if most people weren't on the streets protesting and didn't agree with the SDS.

And by now you ought to know why the point is fatuous. I hope you realize anyway. That the IRS deals with losses caused by inflation in ways that don't help my mother doesn't negate the fact that factoring inflation she in reality had a loss.

Re the local "occupy" event in Vancouver, from today's CBC news:

" About 100 protesters continue to camp on the lawn of the Vancouver Art Gallery just over a week after the protest began."

and:

"On Sunday, dozens of protesters took to the streets, blocking traffic at several downtown Vancouver intersections over the course of a few hours."

That's true. I bought in 2000, then was completely baffled to see resale prices double in this very modest neighborhood. I also feel bad for people saddled with those mortgages. But that doesn't really make the case against banks any less compelling. Questionable loans bundled together helped feed the speculative bubble and the overbuilding wasn't the fault of individuals. Everyone could have been more prudent including Americans who considered their homes their piggy banks, however the financial sector's actions obliterated any chance of a "soft landing."

You are so missing the key point in my post. How can you be that blind? It boggles the mind.

Does the OWS have an unfair advantage of billions of dollars and their own broadcast corporation? Do they have a grossly disproportionate access and influence on government and on the other media outlets (except the Net, our potential saving grace during this brief window before the largest corporate powers that be take tighter control)?

MTV will begin airing a reality TV show based on the Occupy Wall Street protests at Zuccotti Park. Brian Stelter, The New York Times media reporter, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brianstelter">said on Twitter</a> that the series would premiere on on Nov. 5, and would be called “True Life: I’m Occupying Wall Street.” The series apparently began life with a casting call for one of the protesters to join the network’s long-running “Real World” series, Entertainment Weekly reported.

I think that a bit demagogic. I think some percentage want some or all of that. So what? Instead of demonizing the protestors focus on finding and implementing solutions. It's the inertia that's causing the unrest. Belittling protestors is just salt in the wound. Unemployment, low wages, financial scandals, all while the rich get richer and the middle class must live on less and less. I'm worried about the strategy that thinks attacking the protestors ala Marie Antoinette is the solution. Arrogance and contempt is very wrong headed IMO.

Sure and one based on capitalism. Over a third of the protesters think capitalism is inherently evil and unlike the American revolution, we have a democratic process in place that will allow for change. The Tea party harnessed it to their advantage. OWS could do the same if they were actually interested in political change, but they aren't.

<quote orig_author="Robert Prey">
On balance, it would be incorrect to classify Norway as a "Socialist" country. Despite high rates of taxation, and some major industries owned by government, Norway has a very high rating of economic freedom according to the Index of Economic Freedom as published by the Heritage Foundation.

2011 Index of Economic Freedom, -- Heritage Foundation

<a href="http://www.heritage.org/index/country/norway">http://www.heritage.org/index/country/norway</a>

Norways economic freedom score is 70.3, making its economy the 30th freest in the 2011 Index. Its score has increased by 0.9 point since last year, mainly reflecting a considerable gain in freedom from corruption. Norway is ranked 16th out of 43 countries in the Europe region, and its overall score is well above the world and regional averages...

The modern and competitive Norwegian economy has long benefited from its relatively high levels of economic freedom...

The state maintains substantial ownership in many key industries, including enterprises in manufacturing, telecommunications, hydroelectric power, and transportation.

When one of the media people at OWS follows and apologizes to CNBC, the black chick returns and they get into a scuffle with BC breaking an egg over the microphone. Great entertainment value.

Plenty of leftists there including kids from the Little Red Schoolhouse, a communist elementary school in New York City.

Why do you think this is significant? They talk about wet laundry, so what. Is every discussion about items not related to Wall Street? How hard will you work to discredit the group?

There is a big difference between being marginalized in the media and taking a crap in someone's doorway. The Tea Party people at least had the decency to protest then go home and organize.

Visited "Occupy Cleveland" today, to try and get some pics to share. There were about 12 people there. Seriously. I didn't have the heart to take a photo. I waited until about 6 o'clock, then headed over to city hall, where according to their website there was supposed to be a "rally". Saw a half-dozen people sitting on the steps with their signs resting on the stairs next to them. There was no police presence whatsoever in either location.

It's rather odd, considering that this past Friday night there were alleged to be a couple hundred of them in Public Square. That was the night their initial permit to demonstrate on the Square expired and their tent city was due to be evicted by the police. 11 people were arrested for refusing to leave and released about an hour later.

Now their permit has been renewed, but for a space half the size permitted previously and specified no overnight camping, which they complain is unreasonable since their initial permit was already "too small for the movement"; but practically nobody is there. I suppose that without the threat of imminent "police violence", nobody has any incentive to go there and show "solidarity".

I hear rumors about the large presences and events in Boston and Chicago and wonder if, like in Cleveland, it's almost all hype there as well with weekend evenings showing the only real "presence".

ETA: By the way - remember that article I linked about the girl who reported being raped a while ago when Occupy Cleveland had tents? On Twitter I saw somebody mention that the rumor among some of the "occupiers" is that she was a CIA plant. Not kidding.

These people are everywhere, and yet the Tea Party (for example; I could name half a dozen other protest groups over the past ten years with the same record)--and yet the Tea Party gatherings seem to be quite lacking in allegations of rape, statutory rape, theft, noise complaints, permit violations, and public defecations.

Nor does the Tea Party seem to be so mind-bogglingly ignorant of human civilization (despite living in it all of their lives) that they find themselves having to rediscover 10,000 of social institutional evolution, before they can actually get anything done.

Say what you will about the Tea Party; they, at least, have already figured out law enforcement, property ownership, representative democracy, and basic hygiene. On that basis alone they are far more fit to influence our society than the OWS crowd is.

Anything is fair game. To be intelectually fair and honest a person needs to not focus on simply the anecdotes and anomalies. Using rhetoric that paints all of the protestors in a bad light or dismissing all of them as not having any goals does your position no favors.

A person can come here to vent or contribute. Contributing doesn't mean being nice and kind. Contribution can and often should be about criticism. But criticism that ignores realities can't be taken seriously.

I've been critical of this movement. Particularly at the beginning. There's a lot I don't like about it and I've said so. But I resent ham handed dismissal of people who are sick and tired of the BS going on. WS really is hurting people. Something really does need to be done. At first I didn't think this was the right venue but now that people are starting to take notice, now that the agitation is working, I think it was probably the right decision.

I agree with what the signs says but I am wondering if there is evidence that the sign is what happened?

Did they know the loans were bad?
Did they knowingly bundle loans that they knew were misleadingly rated?
Did the buyers of these loans do any due diligence? We are not talking about some guy trying to bilk me out of money but instead multi billion dollar organizations purchasing the bundles.

I know several people in the industry and this is not how they tell it. It was more of a feeling that prices would never go down, so there would be security in the loans, plus many were federally backed, although I do not really know much about Fannie and Freddie.
Should these people have know better sure. Sure, the same as the people who were spending hundreds of billions buying tech stocks before the tech stock collapse. That is what drives these bubbles.

Of course I am sure there were a few who did what the sign said but I don't think that was the cause in general.
As an accountant though I tend to think a good deal of blame falls on the "independent auditors" of AIG and other companies that never dug deep enough and also the ratings agencies.

You don't think the credit ratings (or quality) associated with the bundles were disclosed? Can you offer any evidence that this is true?

Just because when the economy started to turn down the loans lost value doesn't mean the bundlers knew they were misleading.

You don't think anyone was looking at these bundles before. Once the value was no longer there because of falling home prices the loans became "toxic".

Personally I blame the purchasers more than the bundlers except in cases where it can be shown there was fraud which I suspect is a small fraction of the cases.

I agree that just because the purchasers should have done due diligence does not exonerate anyone who was involved in fraud.

Additionally, he argues that excessive derivative use by banks has caused a huge and increasingly complex web of financial instruments. According to his statistics, $55 trillion worth of derivatives are in existence in the U.S. alone. In his view, these derivatives have the power to potentially collapse our financial system if something goes even remotely wrong.

I think that is complete and utter nonsense. I think the buyers should bear responsibility and hey, they paid a price, a big one. But these asses that bundled these investments deserve serious jail time IMO. They hurt just about everyone. The argument that hey, they should be able to do anything they want so long as they can pull of the con is okay if the buyer doesn't do his due diligence. Nonsense.

If it is going to cause serious and long term harm, and it has, then one ought not to be able to pull that crap.

I appreciate this but given your ignorance of the facts I'm hesitent to give you credit. It seems to be a token sop to show that you are not entirely indifferent to the many people who lost their pensions and investments. This caused very real harm. A guy who robs people of their wallets pales to the degree of harm caused by the greedy bastards who pushed worthless loans and then repackaged them in complex derivatives to hide them.

BTW: Deregulation made this possible as firms that would provide the credit ratings for the derivatives were making money from the derivatives thus creating a conflict of interest. No, the truth was not made known to the buyers.

Guess what, the GOP is fighting them tooth and nail. They've demonized Warren and neutered any new policies. Do you know that little has changed. Do you know that this can happen again?

Do you know THAT THIS CAN'T HAPPEN IN CANADA? Do you know why? Because they are not idiots like we are.

Show me the facts instead of saying Matt Taibbi, John Stewart and other have shown it to be fact. I may very well be ignorant of the facts but you should also be careful of what you consider facts.

I do know that so far aside from a few smaller cases there have been no charges filed yet. Do you believe this is because it has not been looked into? Or is it possible that it has been looked into and there is no evidence of fraud in most cases.

It was known what was happening before the crash. People tried desperately to warn people.

</quote>
Of course there were some who warned of it before. There are enough pundits and advisors out there that you can always find people who know something was going to happen. But was it the general belief? I don't think so.

<quote>
I think that is complete and utter nonsense. I think the buyers should bear responsibility and hey, they paid a price, a big one. But these asses that bundled these investments deserve serious jail time IMO. They hurt just about everyone. The argument that hey, they should be able to do anything they want so long as they can pull of the con is okay if the buyer doesn't do his due diligence. Nonsense.

</quote>
Did you read what I said?
Personally I blame the purchasers more than the bundlers except in cases where it can be shown there was fraud. I fulhearted agree those engaged in fraud should be prosecuted and it has nothing to do with the due diligence.

Look, it's simple, when someone finally looked at all of these investments they easily and quickly labeled them "toxic". It really wasn't hard to do. Should the purchasers have been skeptical? Sure, but they had been led down a path to the slaughter. For years the folks selling the investments had been on the up and up.

You don't think the credit ratings (or quality) associated with the bundles were disclosed? Can you offer any evidence that this is true?

According to the documentary Inside Job, the derivatives were rated by the bond rating agencies (such as Moody's and Standard&amp;Poors) and were known to the purchasers, but the ratings were, shall we say, worthless.

Unfortunately the buyers didn't know that.

</quote>
Well, the bond rating agencies were supposed to give an honest assessment (saying "This derivative is junk", "This one is OK", etc.) The purchasers basically trusted the "experts".

As an analogy, its a little like me going to buy a car... I could bring in a mechanic to check it out to see if its in good condition, but if the mechanic lies and says "its good" when the engine is about to fall out of it, you can't really blame me for purchasing it since I was relying on someone who (in theory) had more knowledge than I did.

No, they couldn't guarantee perfection.

Problem is, it wasn't just one or 2 derivatives that they "made mistakes" on... it was pretty much everything.

The problem appeared to be due to the fact that they got paid based on issuing "positive" ratings. If they stated that "this derivative is worthless" they'd likely get less business.

In a case alleging that inflated ratings on risky mortgages led to investment losses, U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said on Wednesday that ratings on notes sold privately to a group of investors were not "matters of public concern" deserving broad protection under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

The Manhattan judge said investors may pursue their lawsuit accusing Moody's, S&amp;P and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which marketed the notes, of issuing false and misleading statements about the notes, which were backed by subprime mortgages and other debt.

Minor point... that last link actually points to fraud that occurred after the banking collapse (where some of the banks tried to get more of the bailout money than they should have) rather than fraud associated with the derivative markets themselves.

Still corrupt though (and indicative that many of those heading banks have "not learned their lessons"). Just not corruption associated with the initial derivative problems.

Police said Tuesday reports of violence, drugs and unsanitary conditions and "overwhelming mental health" concerns were growing at the two camps of 'Occupy Portland' downtown.

From Monday into early morning Tuesday, police logged several fights, two attempted officer assaults, several intoxicated people and port-a-potties overflowing onto the street.

Raw sewage was reported to be running down the sidewalk toward Southwest 3rd Avenue. Parks officials told police "they were aware" of the situation.

Yes, not all of them all the way through. I've been reading about these claims since the whole thing went to hell. It's really not controversial. It really, really isn't. We know what happened. The loans should not have been made. To further this activity these poisionous assets should not have been bundled with other investments that just created a house of cards.

BTW: The Great Depression isn't a great mystery. It happened because the economy can only grow so fast. At some point even the rich have to be patient. But they don't want to so they find creative way to suck money out of an over extended system. But you can't suck the money out forever. Bubbles will always burst. There are no new laws of economics. When you drive the perceived value ever higher a crash is eminent. What we need are corrections so the govt implemented regulations to protect us. Sadly congress listened to the swan song that the economy would be better if we just got rid of those regulations.

Canada didn't have a crash. Canada isn't going to have a crash. Why? They have strict regulations on investments. These kinds of derivatives and conflicts of interests between insurance companies, brokerage firms, investment firms and banks are just as illegal there as they used to be in the US.

A feeling? Mass delusion perhaps. By a LOT of indicators we had a big bubble going on.

That's their job - creating "innovative finance solutions" to keep pushing the law.

So if there isn't any law, well hey. It self-organizes into a Ponzi scheme.

Three men are wanted for threatening to kill a 24-year-old Occupy Wall Street protester because she was pressing charges over an assault at the group's Zuccotti Park encampment.

The young protester was roughed up at the Downtown sit-in by a man named Garfield Leslie, 19, police said Tuesday.

Leslie offered to sell the woman drugs, and when she declined that offer and his romantic advances, he punched her in the face and dished out more blows to two friends who had come to her defense, police said.

The woman filed a complaint with police, and Leslie was arrested at Zuccotti Park about 8 p.m. on Saturday.

Projecting an unvarnished Semitism, I circled the place, encountering nothing and no one to suggest bigotry — not a sign, not a book and not even the guy who some weeks ago held up a placard with the instruction to Google the phrase “Zionists control Wall St.” Google “nut case” instead.

This was my second visit to the Occupy Wall Street site and the second time my keen reporter’s eye has failed to detect even a hint of the anti-Semitism that had been trumpeted by certain right-wing Web sites and bloggers, most prominently Bill Kristol.

You see RandFan. This movement you're supporting is not made up of average Joes, driven to protest by the abuses of Wall Street, with a few radicals on the fringe. It was a big, fat fib when you said it was. Its core consists of people like Bikerdruid. Radical leftists that don't want capitalism to exist at all.

On a given day, I decide that Occupy Wall Street is about nothing and then I decide it is the Herman Cain campaign in aggregate, just a media event that has captured the flea-thoughts of many Americans. Then I decide it is an incoherent articulation of anger at the institutions that have failed us, including  by way of both self-pity and self-flagellation  the media. It seems, above all, a conspiracy to have left-leaning writers make jackasses of themselves by imparting grave and grand meaning to what is little more than a vast sleepover.

Find a group or movement you don't like. Identify a behavior of some in the group or movement that most will find repugnant. Point it out in an attempt to paint all members of the group with the same brush. I've already pointed this out and you keep doing it.

A loss of $300,000 is no big deal to you? Dude? 687 / 418 = 60% What you bet isn't really in evidence is it? But I will concede there was a spike before the collapse. End story my mother purchased her home for $100,000 and sold it for $120,000. That's a fact. It's an anecdote but it's a fact. The loss of value is real harm no matter how you try to spin it.

BTW: I'm always amazed with this kind of apologetics. It's as if we are in the twilight zone and all the misery we thought went through we didn't, it was minor... oh, but blame Obama anyway... odd.

</quote>
You know, it just occurred to me. In the past ten years I've spent a hundred grand on rent. It's gone money never to be recovered and in the next ten years I'll spend another hundred grand, unless of course I loose this place, then I'll spend even more. So comparatively speaking, your mother is making out way better than me and i highly doubt she was complaining as she watched her investment skyrocket in value during the run up.

So why don't I buy a house, I hear you asking yourself. Well, houses around here ( Victoria BC ) start at about 650K. There was no bubble bursting and real estate is still increasing. There's no way i can handle the payments on a mortgage anywhere near that size even with my wife and I working full time.

Obviously I can't blame the banks for real estate prices, hey I live in a very desirable location it's not my fault that the whole rest of the country wants to live here. I can blame myself for not getting into the market in the 1980s when prices weren't so retarded, when you could buy a house, a reasonable house, one you'd want to live in, for a hundred grand. Had I done that, had I actually gotten the house I put in an offer in on back in 1984, I'd be looking at well over half a million in equity right now as well as living rent/mortgage free. My offer wasn't accepted BTW and I never pursued owning real estate when I later moved to Vancouver where a crackshack ran about 400K, and a one bedroom condo, about 150K.

All my wife and I can do is bide our time waiting for people to die so we can get some inheritance cash and maybe get into the market....or move to the boondocks and spend 3-4 hours a day commuting.

So, relatively speaking, you mom did well.

Please read the thread. Laws broken include theft, assault, sexual assault, vandalism, weapons charges, defecation and urination in public, indecent exposure, child neglect and so on.
These parks, such as the ones in Portland, belong to all of us and we take care of them with our tax dollars but they do have rules which are in place to make it better for everybody such as not defecating and not spending the night in the park. The "99%" don't seem to care about the park rules that we came up with as a community (it wasn't big banks that made these rules)

False consolation fallacy.

Had my mother simply lost her investment because of natural cycles I'd be a bit more receptive to your point even if it is a fallacy. As it is, deregulation and the unethical behavior cost her her home and much of her pension and other investments. Your consolation can't obviate the facts.

How did she come to lose her home then? Assuming, of course it was paid for. 20 years, a hundred grand, unless she had an outrageous interest rate then that shouldn't have been a hardship.

I hear you on the investments, I'm not making much of anything now on investments that were paying out at 8%, then along comes the crash and the principal drops by 25%. If she was planning on living off the interest as well as her pension, I feel for her and her loss.

So...what's OWS hoping to accomplish ? Are they demanding regulation of the financial sector ? An increase in social security benefits ? Just how is OWS and their action hoping/planning on "making things better" ? Oh, they're not, they're just complaining about anything and everything.

The OWS protesters have no clue about what their protests will achieve. But I think you make a mistake in thinking that the protests can't accomplish anything. They can, though not what the protesters intend. And what they might accomplish is a demonstration of the street muscle that leftist organizations can flex, and hence provide some credibility for future threats. What we're witnessing is the attempted formation of a racket: pay off those leftist leaders, and you might get protection from this mob. Don't... and you might have to face the mob on your own. This won't bring about any real "reform", but it could definitely lead to a real accumulation of power.

I would have said the same thing, stick it out however after my meeting with my financial advisor yesterday, I would have been wrong as well.

At the risk of committing another one of these fallacies I'll add this is my pension I'm dealing with, my future and i was half thinking about pulling the whole lot out and sticking it in a high interest savings account and sucking up the 1.5% that I know I'll get. At least it would be safe from further losses. He talked me into waiting it out for another year.

They're unlikely to simply laugh this off. Instead, those bankers will just pay off enough leftist leaders to make the problem go away. It's a protection racket. And a racket never shuts down the businesses they leach off of, or they wouldn't be able to leach anymore.

No, I don't at all. Have you had a course in accounting? Do you know what a T account is?
If you have $100,000 that's $100,000 in the cash account. Purchase a home with that money that's $100,000 in fixed assets. Borrow $30,000 against the home that's $30,000 in the cash account minus finance fees and $70,000 in fixed assets. It was a low interest rate loan. When she sold the home she paid back the loan and paid off the interest. He had the loan for a short time. It was basically a wash. No BFD. If she had the money in a CD she could have borrowed the money or liquidated the CD and still would have had more money than the house netted her.

<quote>
According to our friends at Celebrity Net Worth, Moore's fortune currently totals $50 million:

Fahrenheit 911 raked in $230 million in theaters and another $3 million in DVD sales. After the theaters take their traditional 50% cut, that leaves roughly $130 million. Take away marketing, production and distribution expenses and Moore is conservatively left with $80 million. Moore was able to secure a deal from Miramax which guaranteed him 27% of his films net revenues, or roughly $21.6 million. Michael also was entitled to 50% of the profits of Sicko which are estimated to be $17 million.

Moore wants to dress and act as if he's just a regular guy part of the 99 percenters, but he is every bit a multimillionaire doing everything in his power to make more money for himself.

He invests his fortune in stocks - including the Left's most-hated company Halliburton! - and isn't pro-union when it comes to managing his own business.

It presumes that rich people like Buffet can't advocate on behalf of the poor. And accusing Moore of pretending to be poor by the way he dresses is just a personal attack.

Point it out in an attempt to paint all members of the group with the same brush. I've already pointed this out and you keep doing it.

That's a straw man. I don't know of anyone who says that people are bad because they are rich. We are saying that the policies of America favor the rich and the rich lobby to protect those policies. Look at what happened to Elizabeth Warren. Look at the gutting of regulations and the harm caused. Consider the fact that Canada and other nations don't have they dynamics that we have to allow such predatory lending and complex derivatives.

On the other hand, the OWS group is under attack by many who are rich and/or on the right. The proof is in this thread. They are maligned and belittled just for speaking out and seeking redress. So if you are upset with single minded characterizations I think you are looking in the wrong place.

No, it's not too much to ask. Perhaps it would be better but perhaps that not the best way to mobilize. And BTW, not all of them, not most of them, are there to defecate in doorways or enable criminals.

There are a lot of honest and objective reporters who are there and they are not claiming that OWS is just a lawless group bent on enabling criminals and defecating in doorways.

And what is that "do something"? Rand, the OWS protestors are not interested in changing, fixing, or regulating anything. It's about reinventing society into some sort of direct democracy where all decisions are based on consensus. They want to try that, good for them, but do it in a office building or on a college campus.

When ever, in the history of planet Earth has a protest movement been successful without an intended goal?

American Revolution - independence from Great Britian
Gandhi - independence from Great Britian
Suffrage - votes for women
Civil Rights - end segregation, voting rights

Look at the example of suffrage. It was an all male government that passed the 19th Amendment. Do you think that would have happened if all the women said was, "We're mad!"

Perhaps that's best. All I know is that people are tired of the shrinking middle class. Living on less and less and they want to do something about it. In the 60s people protested and changed the world. When I was a child there were not a lot of blacks in public office or in popular culture. Now we there is a black president. People today look to the protests that changed the world and think it could happen again. Can't say I blame them. Sometimes we need agitation. Sometimes we have to make the comfortable uncomfortable to make a change. Being nice and handing out cup cakes doesn't always cut it. I don't condone violence, crime, inappropriate behavior, but over all I support OWS. I didn't at first. I was skeptical and critical but after looking into it I'm convinced it has a reasonably good chance of change. Less than 50% in my estimation but probably better than anything else. JMO.

I've never looked into those. I do, well I used to see them advertised on TV ( DVR now so commercials are a thing of the past ) and the stipulations were no repayments until you move out of your house.

Fast forward to Michel Moore's Capitalism a Love story and the scene in there where a couple is moving out of a house they'd owned for quite some time. Maybe you remember it, they were burning their furniture.

I was curious as to how that would happen, the cause wasn't mentioned in the movie.

I haven't heard a peep out of OWS about using credit wisely.

I'd have to move way up island, Chemainus or somewhere like that. an hour and a half one way to the city, on a good day, double that on a bad day. I haven't looked around at real estate up that way for three years though and it might have gone up as well.

The mainland is ridiculous as art all those islands between Victoria and Vancouver ( Pender Galiano etc )

I don't like Michael Moore. I like his early movies but stopped watching after Bowling for Columbine. His work is propaganda and he cares nothing for logically valid argument.

Thank you. Seriously thank you. This is a very valid and reasonable question. One I am concerned about. It's too easy to simply blame all of our problems on the lending practices of our financial institutions. There does need to be responsibility on the part of those who borrow and invest.

However, we understand human nature and we understand that we as humans can be manipulated. I don't for one moment advocate govt attempting to remove any and all risk from consumers. I don't want a govt that is strictly paternal. However, we can, like the Canadians impliment common sense policies to protect consumers and protect the economy. When the Banks gamble with deposits and financial institutions make bad loans to people with bad credit then that puts us all at risk. Especially when these banks are "too big to fail". That means that you and I must bail them out while we hold the individuals responsible for their mistakes. Uh-uh. That's got to stop.

Look, many conservatives get this. Folks like Paul Volker and David Stockman. We can have risk and let people make mistakes and suffer the consequences of their actions without bringing the entire system to the brink of disaster. It's really doable. Hell, we learned our lessons from The Great Depression.

Funny thing, that human nature. Heck I once ran up all my credit cards, in the 1980s and used imminent destruction by a Russian nuke as justification. Remember that doomsday clock that was one minute to midnight ? I figured if i was going to die, I might as well die in debt. Needless to say the missile never happened and I was faced with either bankruptcy or austerity. Bankruptcy wasn't all that appealing as I had a decent job so austerity seemed like the best bet.

Then I got hit by a car while riding my bicycle, the insurance settlement went directly into paying off those cards and I've been scared of credit ever since. I call it life.....plus 18% and only use them when absolutely necessary.

I fully agree with your post, I just don't think OWS and their tactics of not making any demands or having a focus is going to be effective. Were they focusing on policy reforms or consumer education ( credit is not income, that sort of thing ) I'd sympathise with them, however this rag tag band of "the usual suspects" painting themselves as perpetual victims of capitalism just isn't cutting it.

So...what's going to happen on Nov 5, bank transfer day ? is the 99% meaning all of us, going to flock to the credit unions ? I won't be because I already have my money in a credit union and have had for years.

I've no idea how you presume to know all of this. "Their meetings"? All of the people from across the US or even all of the people in NY york attend these meetings?

Look, when you are being reasonable I can sympathize with your complaints and I think you have some valid points. However, when you presume to know what they are all doing and thinking I can't take you seriously. That kind of rhetoric doesn't advance the discussion and doesn't appear to be in good faith. How do you expect me to respond? Seriously? "Oh, okay, well, if you say it and you can read everyone's mind and or you attend every meeting of every protestor"...

Could we stick to what you know and what you think? Let me give you an example, if you think something is true then say "It seems to me...". That way I'll give what you say some serious considerations. Otherwise, what's the point? I could claim that all of the OWS protestors travel to Mars on Sunday nights to be educated by Xenu and therefore their purpose is righteous. Are you going to take THAT seriously?

I just ask that you at least treat me without contempt and consider that I might actually have the ability to judge things skeptically and critically and that I might enjoy conversing with like minded people in order to advance the dialectic. I'm here to defend what I perceive of OWS not to convert everyone to my POV.

You've given a list of suggestions you say have been gleaned from different members of the movement; and you say that these things convince you that OWS is a great thing. But you can't honestly claim that your list of well-reasoned "suggestions" represents even the bulk of the feelings and thoughts of OWS, any more than we can claim that a need to provoke violent police confrontation is a need shared by all of OWS. The most you can say is "a few people seem to think blank ".

...which is one of my big problems with the "movement". Usually a movement stands for something; OWS doesn't stand together about anything save a few vague platitudes, because they'd rather not risk the loss of support that taking a specific stand would create.

You say that like it's a good thing. In fact, it's a quite notable weakness of the protests that they don't have any one issue that galvanizes them (and no, "we hate the rich" doesn't qualify). I have criticized the antiwar protestors in the 1960s and recently, but at least they had a recognizable objective.

I have chatted with the local protestors online and tried to draw them into discussions about specific issues. Their response is always the same, "Come downtown and join us!" To a large extent the impression I get is that it's all about rebelling, Marlon Brando-style:

And I'm sick and tired that the only thing the GOP can respond with is the rhetoric of "class warfare". To accuse those who point out the facts as being divisive. Increase tax rates on the rich and incentivize corporations to invest in domestic labor.

Forty-three percent of Americans agree with the views of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, according to a new CBS News/New York Times poll that found a widespread belief that money and wealth should be distributed more evenly in America.

Twenty-seven percent of Americans said they disagree with the movement, which began more than a month ago in lower Manhattan and has since spread across the country and around the world. Thirty percent said they were unsure.

In politics, it’s tempting to turn matters of temperament into matters of principle. Having disliked the hippie-dippy mellow aggression of the ’60s, my first instinct was to dismiss the Occupy Wall Street movement as feckless left-wing tribalism—as unlikely to survive the winter’s first strong cold front as the black flies pestering my cows.

Conservative by nature, I dislike big cities, and tend to avoid crowds. Even in my 20s, I’d no more have joined the drug-addled migration to Woodstock than volunteered for sex-change surgery. We spent that week in Dublin, visiting Jonathan Swift’s tomb—the 18th century Irish satirist who took a dim view of human nature.

...

Except during times of grave national danger—the Great Depression, for example—it’s pretty much remained a dream. Taibbi’s point, however, is that the ongoing economic crisis created by Wall Street greed and recklessness makes it possible that a new movement taking aim at incestuous political and financial corruption in Washington might have a chance.

Breaking up “too-big-to-fail” banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, for example, might be an issue left and right could coalesce around. Just last week, Citigroup agreed to pay a $285 million settlement to the SEC to settle charges that it swindled mainly institutional investors like pension funds in a billion-dollar derivatives scam—deliberately creating junk securities based upon bad mortgages, then shorting them in the market.

I think that's what people don't get. Washington doesn't exist for the people. It exists only for the rich. To bail them out when they gamble with depositors money, raid pensions, ignore criminality destroy evidence of corruption (AND ADMIT IT) allow the gutting of deregulation, ignore the erosion of competition while mega corporations grow ever larger and banks become too big to fail so public money must bail them out.

Sad to see that the police turned violent in Oakland and attacked the protesters there; in particular a young guy called Scott Olsen, who has sustained head injuries that have left him in a critical condition:

You say that like it's a good thing. In fact, it's a quite notable weakness of the protests that they don't have any one issue that galvanizes them (and no, "we hate the rich" doesn't qualify). I have criticized the antiwar protestors in the 1960s and recently, but at least they had a recognizable objective.

Please read the thread. Laws broken include theft, assault, sexual assault, vandalism, weapons charges, defecation and urination in public, indecent exposure, child neglect and so on.
These parks, such as the ones in Portland, belong to all of us and we take care of them with our tax dollars but they do have rules which are in place to make it better for everybody such as not defecating and not spending the night in the park. The "99%" don't seem to care about the park rules that we came up with as a community (it wasn't big banks that made these rules)

I fully agree with your post, I just don't think OWS and their tactics of not making any demands or having a focus is going to be effective.

That picture got discredited as rampant guesswork, and it's been pointed out several times that it's possible to oppose an economic system that allows massive inequality without opposing capitalism itself. For example, Germany manages to do alright with a gini coefficient of ~25, which certainly suggests the american gini coefficient of 47 isn't a requirement for a successful economy.

It's possible to protest against corporations without wanting those corporations to disappear (many just want changes in the way business is done). While there are anarchists and people involved with OWS who would like an end to capitalism, not all do and I suspect most don't. I really find such an argument disingenuous. By your logic the only valid protest would be by people who never consume any goods. BTW: It's possible to want goods that are currently produced by capitalism but want them produced by other means (state owned businesses).

Now, let's be crystal clear here, I'm a BIG fan of capitalism. I didn't take the username RandFan on a whim. I think capitalism has been the greatest engine for prosperity and human flourishing humankind has ever known. But I find your point silly and unproductive to the discussion. It's ad hominem.

isn't that a stupendous image ? I highly suspect it was created by Ad-busters, the initiators of the OWS movement as an educational tool to raise awareness and empower consumers to make the decision to consider buying locally produced goods from small independent merchants rather than supporting the megalithic corporations.

It's designed to stimulate inner reflection while at the cash register and meant to inspire questioning whether ( or not ) the consumer is making a ethical/moral purchasing decision. What do I mean ? Let's take p the purchasing of say, a t-shirt with a corporate logo on it and let's take The Gap as an example.

After viewing that annotated photograph a consumer might just come to the realisation that spending the extra money for a t-shirt that prominently displays a corporate logo might not be a wise idea. The consumer may reflect on the idea that they've been brainwashed by the corporate media and question whether GAP is a message they really want to communicate to the world.

The consumer may make the right decision in this case, put down that sweatshop made piece of corporate iconism, march out of the store empty handed and seek out a small local retailer selling fair trade goods.

I understand there's a fair amount of resistance to become conditioned to the manufactured need to openly display corporate logos and I'm rather dismayed to see that programed behaviour among my self appointed representatives, the occupy protesters.

Imagine, if you will, my dismay at our local occupy protesters failing to get ( or, horrors, actually ignoring ) this message. Last night when visiting the protesters in the middle of the night I happened to notice that one of the tents had the words The North Face proudly displayed across the top of the fly. This logo was so big, I'm sure you could pick it up on google earth.

Rousting the occupant of the tent I demanded to know why that logo was there demeaning the purity of the protest and all I got in response was a series of muttered profanities. I decided to raise my voice a little as the occupant was obviously reluctant to come to grips with the sin he was committing, some say I was shrieking, but, truth be known, sometimes my normally deep and authoritarian voice becomes somewhat shrill when I'm overwhelmed with passion.

After much "shrieking" I managed to not only raise the occupant but the entire camp as well. My new students were somewhat reluctant to receive my anti-corporate message as well as my suggestions that they make their occupy tents out of recycled materials. I decided a demonstration of the power of handmade goods over the mass produced corporate offal was needed.

Taking a cue from post #635 in this very thread, the one with the words,

<quote>
ya gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet.

</quote>
Aside: Did you ever notice how tents resemble eggs, how they're egg shaped and how they "hatch" occupants out of them in the morning ?

I decided it was time to break some eggs, to take a little "direct action" against the oppressive corporate presence that was polluting the entire scene. Reaching into my back pocket I produced a cleverly concealed, hand made using centuries of tradition, Japanese katana and proceeded to deface that corporate logo in what some say, a very "maniacal" manner. Passionate is the descriptor that I prefer.

So what do my students do ? They get on their corporate produced smartphones and call the very people they themselves are claiming to resist, the police. The fascist enforcers of the capitalist system.

Which is why I'm posting this from a mental health facility, being held here against my will but at least I'll be able to add survivor of the mental health industry to my resume.

I suppose I would be more amiable toward the occupy "movement" if they hadn't allowed Anonymous to so thoroughly infect it with their V for Vendetta fanboy culture. Last night over Twitter I heard a lot of people proclaiming that "occupy Oakland" had resolved to have a general strike next week "on Nov. 5th!!!". Considering that November 5th falls on a Saturday this year, a general strike on that day seemed idiotic to me. Fortunately, further tweets clarified that the strike was slated to happen on November 2, not November 5, restoring some of my faith that the occupiers aren't complete morons.

Higher income tax at higher levels of income, higher capital gains tax at higher levels of income from capital gains, higher inheritance tax on larger inheritances, lower sales tax. Implement UHC, reduce military spending to help fund it.

That would be where i'd start, anyway. There's plenty of other things that could be done such as subsidising higher education to a greater extent to people from poorer backgrounds (such that if you were from a poor background, you didn't need to be an incredible genius to have the same chance as a rich kid of "better than average" ability), but the above measures would probably be the main ones.

The report also concludes that the top 20 percent of US households increased its share of national income while every other quintile saw its share decline. The top 20 percent received 53 percent of income in 2007—that is, its income surpassed the income of the other 80 percent of Americans.

Has anyone been able to figure out yet what the OWS is for? Or against for that matter? I told Fiona at her forum that their slogan is a good start. It's catchy. It's marketable.

But now they need product.

They have to start by getting rid of the dopers and the clowns on stilts. Why? Because most people in the lowest two quintiles aren't clowns on stilts and they're alienating their customer base.

The real problem facing them is that everyone in each quintile hopes and expects to get into the next quintile up from them--somehow and some way. Once you're in that next quintile, there's not a hope in hell that you're going to accept any resolution that puts you back in the stew with the quintile you just left.

Frankly, anyone supporting these weekend homeless slummers should be asking their representatives for clarity and accepting nothing less. " How do I benefit? " should be the first question asked. If the answer is murky then skip them and find a group that knows how to frame an unambiguous programme.

It's a problem a lot of systems have to face if they deal with the homeless. Within the homeless population, there are a lot of mentally damaged people (either genetically or due to drugs), and to maintain a safe space for everyone involved, that sort of thing needs to be confronted.

On top of that, I don't think you quite understand the point of the movement. No one is demanding goodies. The movement stands against a broken system. That concepts tied to economic injustice are viewed as "demanding goodies" is simply disgusting to me.

That said, there are almost certainly people that one can find in the movement which are going to be demanding the utter downfall of capitalism, violent revolution, complete welfare states, etc. That's part of an inclusive movement. What cannot be allowed is allowing the discussion to center around the fringe in an attempt to discredit the movement at large. It happened to the Tea Party, and it's happening now.

I've solved the second one on my own. Greed caused the collapse of various markets just as greed fuels their expansion. That was simple.

Who needs a jobs bill? I just read that Alabama farmers can't get ordinary American citizens to pick their tomatoes. The US is the engine room of the global economy and there are hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs just waiting for hard-working applicants.

Those two solutions probably repair the other two on their own. No street demonstrations required.

The main summary chart is the one on the right. Since 1979, adjusted for inflation, incomes of the broad middle class (solid blue line labeled "21st to 80th percentiles") have increased about 40 percent, which comes to a sluggish 1 percent per year.

Here's the thing. Regulations or lack thereof are never an issue when everyone has two cars in the pot and a chicken in each garage. But when things are slightly on the sour side, it's ramming speed towards the law court buildings with all phasers on kill.

Why is that?

Why wouldn't you be as outraged at things going well as at things going not-so-well if it really was some "incestuous relationship" at work? It's because we're all greedy. Not just Wall Street Fat Cats (many of whom are quite a bit more slender and fit than some of the "protesters" I've seen) or Capitol Hill Pork Eaters.

If you blame "them" for the economic downturn are you right in line to praise "them" when things are going well?

But that wasn't fast enough for them so they commited fraud, wrote loans they knew were bad, packaged them with other good assets, sold them to unsuspecting investors and THEN bet against the investments (now I'll grant you that hedging investments is not per se unethical but in this case there's no question about it).

I can buy this and would add to it.

When a "movement" appears out of "nowhere" to take advantage of an opportunity then it's best to keep a remote and sceptical appreciation. The opportunity was an economic downturn although precisely the same conditions were in place when the economy was booming (or at least appeared to be booming). This means that the "movement" was altogether content as long as the system worked to their benefit and regardless of any perception of "corruption".

In most universes this would be considered unprincipled or hypocritical. Why isn't it here? On a sceptics forum of all places?

I wouldn't really agree with this sentiment. There was a large contingent that agreed the system was broken for a long, long time before things ever went bad. It takes things going bad, however, for it to have a personal impact. People act when the system affects their own lives. It's just the way it's always been. Movements happen when they happen. Would you consider the Tea Party unprinicipled or hypocritical for not protesting the things they spoke against when they were going on for years before their movement began? What about white protesters in the civil rights movement?

I don't really see where you're getting at with this, unless you're about to release some "Obama/Soros grand puppetmaster scheme in time for a wag the dog operation for election year" theory on us.

Assets are neither "good" nor "bad" but have various degrees of risk associated with turning them into cash. Mitigation of risk is a principle/policy that goes back to medieval banking systems. Pooling capital and pooling risk was what launched Lloyd's of London and the VOC. It's nothing new.

Specific individuals have been taken to court for lying about what was contained in specific and traceable transactions but of the world's trillions secured in such arrangements these are a drop in the bucket. The buyers were content to never ask a question because the returns were so much better than the zero per cent offered overnight.

My question is where do you stop? Do you want to outlaw covered derivatives? I think the legal channels used right now are ample to deal with proven and traceable fraudulent transactions or intentionally deceptive marketing practices. But I also think that the people who jumped at market-plus returns have to also be taken into account for their own irresponsibility.

Look at the market today. Do you really believe the S&amp;P is worth 3% more than it was yesterday? Three per cent in one day? Where is the outrage? Where is the massive international investigation into this anamoly? If there isn't one then the OWS (and you and I for that matter) are simply hypocrites.

Well we don't have Republicans here in Canada so nobody here cares about telling women what to do with their bodies.

The people who used to work at Bear Stearns and Lehman Bros possibly wonder where their reward is. They sure didn't get one. There's this abiding misperception that everyone got bailed out when clearly they didn't. It was only once they realised that the entire global credit system had locked up that they had to act. One insider at Bank of England said that we were within about three hours of complete meltdown. Possibly an exaggeration for effect but it wouldn't surprise me.

That complete collapse of the housing market didn't happen in Canada either and we pay a risk premium for our regulations. Americans have loudly and almost uniformly declaimed against regulations. Is it really acceptable in the US to demand more government interference in your movements, actions, potential gains, potential losses? I'd thought it was almost in your Constitution to prohibit such a thing.

I'd balk at calling the past ten years a "nightmare". That description ought to be reserved for the Greatest Depression or any of a dozen of them stretching back into the 19th century. I can honestly state that the worst economic phase of my own lifespan was the "stagflation" of the 1970s. We've had nothing close to either of those conditions in the past ten years.

I can't do much for your other issues though. Congress is your baby.

Oh, there is so much we can do. First, we need the Volker rule now. It's unbelievable we can't implement that. That would go a long way to solving problems. No more gambling with other people's money. Then, and this is a no brainier that began with the depression, Separate the entities. AIG should have never been allowed to blur lines between banking, investing and insurance. Same with with other institutions. Full transparency. Credit ratings from independent agencies for each of the investments. As for the rest, having read experts like Volker and journalists like Taibbi, I'd look to the Canadian system. There regulations would prevent this.

Look, it's a common tactic to scream that it's just not possible to solve these problems. BS, other nations do just fine.

I may not speak for everyone, but I don't really have any animosity toward Joe Analyst at Goldman Sachs. The main people that I feel got away with something terrible are the investors/executives who came up with the ideas of CDOs and sold them, the ratings agencies who were complicit in giving subprime-composed CDOs (and CDO-squareds) AAA ratings at the senior tranche purely due to accounting trickery, and the legislative bodies who deregulated the market, allowing this to happen. There has been no reconciliation, and there is likely not to be.

He is likely not wrong. When Bear Stearns was forced into bankruptcy in America, international law was not considered. All assets held by a company in bankruptcy are frozen in the UK. This meant that all holdings in Bear Stearns UK branch could not be reached, leading to debts not being able to be paid, leading to the system spiralling. AIG was put on the hook for a LOT of credit default swaps as a result of this, and Goldman Sachs called them on something like 2-3 billion (with a b) in money owed with no leeway for time to collect the money. AIG was on the precipice of going under, and if they had gone under, there would have been a HUGE domino effect on global credit markets. We were really that close to global meltdown.

SEGMENTS of America have spoken loudly against regulation. Other segments have spoken loudly for it. The money and lobbying power is in the deregulation camp (obviously), so that's where all the legislation has gone for 30 years now. It is acceptable legally to have higher government regulation, to the point that Teddy Roosevelt's trustbusting is something spoken highly of (or at least, it was) in history classes. The public sentiment is being swayed toward deregulation. There is room for debate as to what is causing that, and if it's in the public's best interests, but perhaps this is not the thread for that discussion.

That complete collapse of the housing market didn't happen in Canada either and we pay a risk premium for our regulations. Americans have loudly and almost uniformly declaimed against regulations. Is it really acceptable in the US to demand more government interference in your movements, actions, potential gains, potential losses? I'd thought it was almost in your Constitution to prohibit such a thing.

I don't care what you would balk at. I've seen the suffering. I faced eviction. My mother lost her home and investments. I know people who have graduated college and can't get jobs. It's awful. It's rather arrogant of you to be sitting in Canada declaring it's not a nightmare. False consolation fallacy BTW. Just because things could be worse doesn't change the fact that things are bad.

An asset you purchase expecting to have a 5% return but in truth will lose money is bad. I know this. Accounting was my minor and I wrote financial software for two decades. Before I lost my job in 2009 I was an auditor for 8 years. My reports would actually state, "bad asset" if the asset would cost more to service or liquidate than it could possibly return then it was bad. Trivially true.

an employer wants to hire someone that can demonstate commitment, and can accomplish a goal.
someone who has completed a four year degree shows several things:
-time management skills
-the ability to focus on several diverse topics at a time.
-the ability to stick to their commitment and completion.

seems to me that these are all positive things in an employee.

a kid applying for a job at mcdonalds that has completed high school, also demonstrates more to the employer than a high school drop-out.

Your definition of "left-wing extremists" is kind of off the mark. You seem to apply that to any movement that expects working people to be paid a decent day's provisions for a day's work.

The fact that the movement has spread in such great numbers in cities all over the country, with massive actions on the same day, argue against a single focus astroturf organization, like the teatards that the Koch roaches bused in from far and wide to hit specific targets..

Everything that disagrees with your image of reality is a fallacy.

Wake up. The problems that Occupy Wall Street is experiencing were predictable. They are not something that fell out of the sky that nobody could have anticipated. They reveal the intrinsic flaws in the movement.

They want the rich to share more of their wealth (involuntarily, of course, through government taxation). But when it comes time to share their own wealth, the "organic chicken and vegetables, spaghetti bolognese, and roasted beet and sheep’s-milk-cheese salad," that has been donated to them, they get resentful. Suddenly they earned that good food, by their own efforts, and how dare some people who haven't put forth the effort think that they are entitled to share in it.

And they're right. Nobody want to share what they have with a bunch of freeloaders and derelicts. Which is what they themselves are demanding.

<quote>
It seems a core group of beat-niks in New York’s Zuccotti Park has been holding marathon jam sessions from mid-morning until late at night every day, punishing the eardrums of their fellow protesters and the surrounding neighborhood. Teachers at a school across the street have complained they can’t teach. And the local neighborhood community board is holding a meeting Tuesday night in which it could revoke its support of the protests if it’s not satisfied that the noise will subside.

The drummers’ refusal to be silenced has opened cracks in the leaderless movement. The general assembly that has formed to oversee the protests proposed to limit the drumming to two hours per day, but the drummers fought back. One 18-year-old drummer told New York Magazine, “They are becoming the government we’re trying to protest. They didn’t even give the drummers a say... Drumming is the heartbeat of this movement. Look around: This is dead, you need a pulse to keep something alive.” The circles have continued.

Double standard for Tea Party vs. OWS?

<a href="http://wmal.com/Article.asp?id=2320795">Richmond Tea Party Wants Refund from VA Capitol for Land that Occupy is Now Using for Free</a>

<quote>
RICHMOND -- The Richmond Tea Party wants its money back from the city of Richmond for the cost of permits and other fees to use the same area in which Occupy Richmond has settled for nearly the past two weeks for free.

The local branch of the Tea Party says it should be reimbursed for all the fees accrued and paid over the past three years for use of Kanawha Plaza, a city-owned square across from the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank and a few blocks from Virginia state capitol buildings. Occupy Richmond, an affiliate with the Occupy Wall Street movement, moved into the square on October 15 and has not been charged a bill from the city.

A city employee who worked with the Tea Party to get permits for the plaza "told us that the occupiers have not paid for the park, have not paid for the permit, there's no sanitation, there's no trash pick-up -- nothing we had to pay for. They've done none of that," Colleen Owens, spokesperson for the Richmond Tea Party, told WMAL.com.

There are certainly many factors that could contribute to such a thing, and I apologize for not having listed all of them. I merely limited myself to what I assume to be the most common causes. I do not think that an economic/political system can cause a mental disability. I think it can contribute to an atmosphere not beneficial to an already existing mental disability, however.

To be clear though, I did say "mentally damaged," which is absolutely not the same thing.

Now, I will concede that had Obama been able to improve the economy decrease the unemployment rate this wouldn't be happening so you are partially correct. Refusal to increase tax rates while we are waging wars, increasing spending and working to help those who screwed us is a good reason to march in the streets.

I'll concede it's a generalization and I'm happy to correct it. "IMHO, many if not most want that." Fair enough?

Now, do you think can we get others to step up to the plate and admit that they are engaging in fallacy, generalizations and quoting anecdotes to smear an entire group by association and painting with broad brush strokes?

Respect, I think you and I both know the truth to that one. I hope to be proven wrong though. What do you think?

The right thing for them to do if it was really about getting a job would be to walk away from the drumming circles and make connections with responsible people that could steer them toward a job. But see, it's more fun to pretend to be part of a new revolution of slackers than to actually do something to improve your situation.

I did your work for you and looked for the citation for this number, and it's based off a pocket pollster employed by the Wall Street Journal interviewing "nearly 200" protesters. Fantastic methodology.

On top of that, I don't really know if believing capitalism is inherently evil would qualify someone as the fringe. Would it make them ideological pariahs in the modern American political arena? Probably. But does it make them crazy? I would say that it doesn't.

The protesters have a distinct ideology and are bound by a deep commitment to radical left-wing policies. On Oct. 10 and 11, Arielle Alter Confino, a senior researcher at my polling firm, interviewed nearly 200 protesters in New York's Zuccotti Park. Our findings probably represent the first systematic random sample of Occupy Wall Street opinion.

When no one from Occupy Wall Street surrendered the generators, more than 30 uniformed FDNY and NYPD officials entered the park to seize them, witnesses and officials said.

"We did send 30 or 40 firefighters through the park, the police department had its community affairs department there to make sure everyone was safe," Mayor Bloomberg said on his weekly radio show Friday.

"Our first two concerns are the First Amendment and safety, and this was about safety."

The protesters say five generators were seized in total, including one which was biodiesel and ran on used vegetable oil.

However it happened, the safety sweep was a success for the city in more ways than one. Preventing fires is a reasonable concern when you're dealing with a densely packed tent city, but the raid also, conveniently enough, makes it much harder for the protesters to stay warm as the temperatures drop into the low thirties, which will happen as soon as Saturday night. In that sense, seizing generators and gasoline was as much of an offensive maneuver as firing tear gas and flash grenades  and without the PR mess.

What has been an otherwise violence-free period during his six weeks covering the Occupy Wall Street movement, took a turn for John Huddy. He explained what happened during Good Day New York:

"This is somebody I've come across several times for the last few days. He threatened to stab me in the throat with a pen. He ripped the mic out of my hand," said Huddy.

"I have a meeting with Bloomberg," said the incoherent protester. The man was soon arrested by the NYPD.

Because I've conceded that the ones I discuss don't represent the entire movement. I've conceded that the movement has caused problems, serious problems of crime and sanitation. I'm just asking for reciprocity.

The idea is that the system is broken, top down. The government, the businesses, the regulations, everything. It's broken. You're focusing on the one aspect of that which appeals to your existing ideology--namely, taxation, because it fits in with the current "class warfare! O_O" theme that talk radio and other conservative media is running with. Here's something you neglected to quote from the article you used to justify that the OWS protesters are all dirty hippies out for a free lunch (and will use violence to justify it, of course):

<quote>
The vast majority of demonstrators are actually employed, and the proportion of protesters unemployed (15%) is within single digits of the national unemployment rate (9.1%).

</quote>
Again, this is a poorly-conducted poll from a biased source, but it shows that there is something deeper at work here than simple discontent with tax rates or a desire for a free handout. The main grievance that I've heard from the protesters is that the system is broken, yet inescapable, and that needs to change. Certainly, tax rates are a portion of that. But it's not the entire problem, and absolutely not the only thing the protesters stand against.

No. An admission from time to time and an actual discussion of the merits pro and con rather than just posting over and over anecdotes without context or admission of any kind.

Look, I'd like it when I point out that it's an anecdote if someone would say concede the point. BTW: A number of people have stated that these do, by and large, represent the movement. Brainster told me to wake up and admit that these anecdotes are demonstrable of the movement. So, yeah, I'd like an honest discussion. That's all. Seems a fair request.

To criticize the Turks for defending their national border and cheer on the Hebrews for expanding theirs on the land of the other indigenous people you forgot to mention. The only distinctions the Kurds have, they share with many other indigenous people is that they did not show up by boatloads to occupy and settle someone else's land and by contrast majority of Hebrews do not even live in the said Hebrew mother land and are perfectly happy where ever it is they call home.
