RUSSIA ' S POWER (AND STRICTLY PLATONIC) COUPLE

<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia made clear
on Monday that he and his protege, President Dmitri A. Medvedev,
were just friends. Really.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Italy, Putin mocked a question from an Italian
reporter who wanted him to explain the secrets to success in a
"political marriage." Putin has led Russia jointly with Medvedev
for the past two years, after term limits prevented Putin from
running for a third consecutive term as president.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the question had been phrased "in a very literary
way."
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Medvedev and I are people of a traditional orientation,"
Putin said. "I can tell you this with complete certainty. As for
marital unions, you have exaggerated a bit. But we are friends,
friends for many years, I have already said this. And the way that
we have arranged our work today -- it seems to me, we can be proud
of this."
</P>
<P>
Putin was speaking at a news conference with Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, with whom he has long had a close
(working) relationship.
</P>
<P>
When it was his turn to speak, Berlusconi added his own quip.
</P>
<P>
"I have experience in many areas: in urban planning, in
publishing, in sports, in television, in public works," Berlusconi
said. "But I have not done so well with regards to marriage, so I
will not begin to give advice."
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi has had a stormy personal life, and he and his second
wife are divorcing.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev was not part of the visit. But in an interview with
Danish television that was released by the Kremlin on Monday,
Medvedev acknowledged that he and Putin did not always agree on
everything.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the similarities in our circumstances, we have had
different experiences, and we may have different views on some of
the nuances as to how our political system should develop,"
Medvedev said.
