<P>
The Supreme Court is weighing whether Costco and other discount sellers can offer cut-rate goods from foreign manufacturers without violating U.S. copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
The justices heard argument Monday in a dispute between Costco and the Swiss watch maker Omega over a line of watches that Costco sold for a third less than they cost elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The case has important implications for discount sellers like Costco and Target as well as eBay, Amazon and other companies that form an estimated $58 billion annual market for goods that are purchased abroad, then imported and resold without the permission of the manufacturer. The U.S.-based sellers, and consumers, benefit from the common practice of manufacturers to price items more cheaply abroad than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The software, book, music and movie industries say a broad ruling for Costco also could threaten their ability to retain control over copyrighted works. By contrast, public and university libraries worry that a decision in favor of Omega could force them to withdraw foreign-made books from circulation.
</P>
<P>
Omega sued Costco for copyright infringement after the wholesale membership club offered Omega's Seamaster watch for $1,299. The suggested retail price was $1,995.
</P>
<P>
Costco purchased the watches from a company in New York. Omega initially sold at least some of the watches to an authorized distributor in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The high court already has ruled that copyright protections do not apply when the goods are made in the U.S., sold abroad and reimported. This case concerns only foreign-made items.
</P>
<P>
A decision is expected in early 2111.
</P>
<P>
The case is Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Omega, S.A., 08-1423.
