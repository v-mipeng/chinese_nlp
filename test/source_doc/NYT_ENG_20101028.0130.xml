FAME OF LADY GAGA IS TOPIC OF SOUTH CAROLINA COURSE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta may not sound famous, but the
University of South Carolina is offering a course next spring
devoted to her -- and the sociology of fame.
</P>
<P>
Apparently one secret to becoming famous is to change your name.
Germanotta now goes by Lady Gaga.
</P>
<P>
What else accounts for the soaring popularity of the 24-year-old
global phenom? The question has intrigued and inspired Mathieu
Deflem, 48, a sociology professor at the University of South
Carolina at Columbia, who plans to teach a course called "Lady
Gaga and the Sociology of Fame." He believes it is the only such
full-time college course in the country.
</P>
<P>
He wants to explore what makes a person famous and what being
famous means in today's culture. Or, as the course description puts
it: "The central objective is to unravel some of the
sociologically relevant dimensions of the fame of Lady Gaga."
</P>
<P>
This course could also be called "Obsession." Deflem said he
was instantly entranced with Lady Gaga when he saw her on "The
Tonight Show" in January 2009. Then he went to a concert in
Atlanta. That led to his traipsing after her around the world to
more than 28 shows. He owns more than 300 of her records on vinyl
and CD, most of which are international releases. He has started a
website, gagafrontrow.net, a respectful and adoring fan site with
pictures and audio downloads of rare Gaga songs.
</P>
<P>
Deflem has met Lady Gaga five times, which was easy in the old
days (last year), but now he warns on his site: "Do not contact me
about how to meet Lady Gaga. I don't know. I met her during meet
and greets that were organized at the concerts (during the Fame
Ball tour and the early Monster Ball tour), and once, per chance,
at an airport. I am not in touch with her nor with her
management.)"
</P>
<P>
Still, he harbors hope that she might visit his class. "I will
get the word out to her that I'm doing the course," he said, "but
it might be logistically too difficult for her to come" because
she will be on tour for most of the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
Her tour includes Atlanta, however, which is about a three-hour
drive from Columbia. Perhaps the course will include a class trip.
