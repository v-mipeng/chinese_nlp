There's word now that "Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn will not allow a proposal that would cover health-care costs for ground zero workers to go through the Senate before Christmas" (via The Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire blog).

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-OK.
Politico says ilt's been told by Coburn that "he wouldn't allow the bill to move quickly, saying he has problems with parts of the bill and the process Democrats are employing."

It is nothing new for heartless retards, and NO, it isn't reasonable. Why don't we hold up your paycheck until April until we can make spending cuts that have nothing to do with your wages. Don't play dumbass on us with reasonable.

This is the same thing Reagan did with the hostages. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

Because weak-minded people form their opinions based on their emotions rather than looking at the whole picture.

I'm guessing their health plans probably didn't cover everything, so yeah, the feds should pick up the remaining tab, but I do question the $7 billion price tag. That seems like an awful lot of money being asked for.

</quote>

Much of that price tag is actually:

Building infrastructure (Not sure why we need infrastructure. If we are insuring people, the hospital system works fine for me. The most we would need is a few people to screen to make sure no one is committing fraud).
Researching "9/11 related illnesses" which if you look at the wording of the bill is just about every single disease known to man.

When I read it it seemed more that they were trying to use 9/11 to send pork to their special interests while pretending to help the actual victims.

BTW what ever happened to all the private charity that was gathered for this very reason?

I have one question, how much money have these fucking people already been given? Weren't billions set aside for these people? How long, and how much money are we to be held hostage for because they helped clean up ground zero? Additionally, how can one prove any cancer that these people might have developed didn't come from other sources? So anyone who worked the cleanup and gets cancer will now be eligigle for millions more at the taxpayer expense? Maybe I should go up there to ground zero and sweep up a little so I can get mine.

Cause we all know that Republican's don't spend, right?

It's not like the budget has skyrocketed EVERY YEAR for the last 50.

Even His High Holiness Saint Reagan the First increased spending.

Why? Who, of the Responders was not insured? What Insurance doesn't cover could easily be handled with Riders, much more economically than what is being proposed here. Why the big production? Are we transferring the Burden here? Who is getting off the hook regarding compensation, should this Bill pass? Why the false claim that these people are not covered?

That does not answer the question. Nice deflection though. Why aren't these people covered under their current Insurance and Comp? Why the need in the first place? Why is your fix the only fix? Why the abuse from the current system which you have chosen to expand? Is this what we all have to look forward to? Denial of service? Denial of coverage? Fighting Workman's comp? Fighting the Insurance companies? Fighting the Government for basic obligations? Is it all a lie? Is that it? You want more money to do less? NYFD is now going to be charging us to respond to car accidents and that makes sense to you? Right? Sounds to me like the only thing needed here is a Grand Jury, and a few hundred Indictments, for Fraud, starting with the City Bureaucracy that Administrated this fraud. You could not be in deeper hypocritical bullshit.

Who told you that? As most people who have insurance know, there are exclusions for wars, etc. So show me they were covered by insurance. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_angel.gif"/> Show me who has been paying the insurance bill (most likely you).

That sounds like a lesson in humility to me. An omission that you can't count on the private sector, and the very reason government must intervene and do so many different social programs.

I can't count on you to buy five blankets for the poor family living under the bridge, mainly because you don't know they are there. A social worker knows they are there, and sets in motion a care system to aid and provide basic needs for a family. Private sector? LMAO!!! They can't even wipe their ass.

Some "truths".

The government told those people it was "safe". And remember who the "government" was at that time.

I watched one of the responders on the news just a couple of hours ago. He said he went to 44 funerals of friends he worked with who were also first responders who all died during the last 4 years. Every one of them had cancer. They were in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. He asked the crowd to raise their hand, everyone who has been to 44 or more funerals during the last four years (he was the only one who raised his hand).

The thing that gets me. These are all a bunch of policemen and firemen and hard working construction workers and other American heroes and Republicans act as if they were a bunch of sponges and criminal trash who are trying to "pull one over" and from my understanding, all they are seeking is "medical care".

If they were rich, Republicans would find a way to get them treatment for free. You wanna bet?

I just watched Coburn on Fox say that this bill has never been through committee. Then they showed the list of those that was on the committee Coburn said the bill never went through back in June and lo and behold, Coburn's name was on the list of those on the committee he said the bill never went through. Then they showed pictures of the "meeting" and highlighted Coburn's chair, which was empty, because he never showed up.

I bet this shows up on Youtube because it was hilarious.

There's word now that "Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn will not allow a proposal that would cover health-care costs for ground zero workers to go through the Senate before Christmas" (via The Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire blog).

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-OK.
Politico says ilt's been told by Coburn that "he wouldn't allow the bill to move quickly, saying he has problems with parts of the bill and the process Democrats are employing."

Yeah, there are no set plans on how the money will be spent. None at all.

so a smart man just prevented more waste. And by doing so, ensures that it will get to the right people.

fyi; the dems had all year to work on this but blew it off until now. so ask them why they took so long in doing this, then ask why they don't give a damn about these heroic volunteers.

Gotta love it. Such a show of compassion from all our board Conservatives. Yet they were crying buckets at the thought of the rich having to pay the taxes they paid in the '90s.

Sure, so, perhaps we can talk Moore into taking more of the 9-11 responders to Cuba.

Tom Coburn is a medical doctor. A typical Right Winger, he appears on Fox and says the bill never went through a committee and received a hearing and it did all the way back in June and in typical right wing fashion, HE WAS A MEMBER OF THAT COMMITTEE. But he says that doesn't count.

I don't get the right wing. It seems their leadership can do anything and get away with it.

Apologize to BP
Hold millions hostage to get tax cuts for rich people who didn't even want them
Push for more spending in Afghanistan
Denying first responders needed medical care
Number one concern is to beat Obama and make sure he fails

Why is the base protecting these politicians? Do they really and truly agree with these positions?

Coburn also argued that the bill, entitled the Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, "hasn't even been through a committee." Coburn added: "We haven't had the testimony to know." (ThinkProgress notes that on June 29, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions - on which Coburn sits - held a hearing on the bill. But Coburn's office says that doesn't amount to having gone "through a committee.")

Meanwhile, a growing chorus of Republican commentators has begun to pressure GOP senators to revise their positions, arguing that the health of first responders is a sensitive national issue - and that opposing it could be politically unwise.

"It's just like taking care of veterans' health care... It can't be a good move for Republicans to oppose a bill for the firefighters and the cops on 9/11."

Mike Huckabee
Shepard Smith

Perhaps we can talk Michael Moore into stop being a hypocrite and to start writing the government a check for 70% of his income since that's what he thinks the rates should be for others.

And if you actually believe that Cuba has a superior health care system to the U.S., then it's no wonder why you need other people to pay your bills and wipe your ass for you.

On the news, they said it was a "stand-a-lone" bill. I don't know if that was true.

The bill's online on Thomas.gov

Check it out.

Am I reading it wrong or is it like ten pages? Yea, I was reading it wrong.

But I didn't see anything so far not related to first responders. Guess I have to read the whole thing.

</quote>

Then you sure as heck aren't reading it carefully.

BTW Can you tell me what provision of the Constitution authorizes this bill?

Coburn is my Senator and his OKC office is in the building directly across the street from mine. More power to him. You know, I'm reminded of my brother-in-law and his wife. He left the finances to her and trusted her. She almost spent them into bancruptcy. He took the checkbook away from her, cut up her cards and borrowed $5,000 from my wife and I to stave off bankruptcy. He then paid us $100 a month until he got it paid off.

Sure, first responders at ground zero tug at our heart strings. Hey, befor 9/11, the largest terrorist attack on US soil happened right here in OKC just blocks away from my office. All that being said, you simply can't spend what you don't have. This is a principle that Coburn governs with. If you want to spend, you either have to come up with a way to pay for it or find somewhere to cut to pay for it or both. Honestly, a flood here or a hurricane there is no sweat off my back because it doesn't affect me. To those who are affected, it is a big deal. The problem is, while saying on one hand that we need to tighten the belt, we all have our pet projects that are an sxception. Coburn simply says no more exceptions. If you want it, find a way to pay for it. Even though it appears so, the government doesn't shit real money. At some point, the piper has to be paid. Coburn is trying to staunch the flow. As I said earlier, more power to him. We need a whole lot more like him.

Some "truths".

The government told those people it was "safe". And remember who the "government" was at that time.

I watched one of the responders on the news just a couple of hours ago. He said he went to 44 funerals of friends he worked with who were also first responders who all died during the last 4 years. Every one of them had cancer. They were in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. He asked the crowd to raise their hand, everyone who has been to 44 or more funerals during the last four years (he was the only one who raised his hand).

The thing that gets me. These are all a bunch of policemen and firemen and hard working construction workers and other American heroes and Republicans act as if they were a bunch of sponges and criminal trash who are trying to "pull one over" and from my understanding, all they are seeking is "medical care".

If they were rich, Republicans would find a way to get them treatment for free. You wanna bet?

The Government is New York State and NYC. Who are you kidding? You could not get farther away from Conservative. NY is run by the DNC and the Unions. Why are they being denied Workman's Compensation Insurance coverage, and treatment? You could not be more full of shit. Fucking "Atlas Shrugged" is being unveiled before our eyes.

Even the Oklahoma City Fireman ragged on Coburn. His next run for re-election should be interesting.

<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dc/2010/12/oklahoma-city-firefighters-target-tom-coburn.html">Oklahoma City Firefighters Target Tom Coburn | New York Daily News</a>

"We lived through the horror in Oklahoma City in April 1995, and many of our members responded to Ground Zero during 9/11. Fire fighters are always there for our country, and we need Tom Coburn and Jim Inhofe to be there for our FDNY brothers and sisters!

The Oklahoma Fire Fighters urge our two Senators to stand tall with America's first responders. Instead of employing procedural tactics of delay, vote to give the hero's of 9/11 the protection and benefits they have earned.
