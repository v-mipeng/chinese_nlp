The chances of the president not being American are incredibly low; Blair is probably the only non-American who could get it. Why isn't Volcker on your list? I thought him and Zoellick were the favorites.

I took it straight from the Center for Global Development article and he wasn't on there, that's why.

I suppose it is a bit far fetched to expect the president to be the most relevant one. Volker would be competent but is far from the best option, he's got a glittering monetary policy background but has basically no experience of development.

Gah! *Exasperation* Jesus Christ, that went down like a lead balloon, I'll edit it if people are really that touchy.

Anyway, the topic. I'm in favour of Fischer due to the incredible depth of his experience and the fact that he's so well versed in economics. Micro, Macro, Development, Financial markets, monetarism, growth, Solow, Keynes, Friedman, he's studied or taught them all (in fact Friedman was his boss at one point). Whether he's 'in favour' with Bush or not is a different matter but, for my money, he's the best choice.

Although Fischer seems to be the ideal candidate (I mean, he was even tutor to the Fed chairman Ben Bernanke), Zoellick seems likely to get the job from what I've heard - he's an American, has good foreign policy experience and is viewed favourably by Bush as well as others for being early to attack the situation in Darfur.

It doesn't matter that he's an economist. No one listens to economists when it comes down to it. All the policy makers nod when you explain the basics and then go and do the exact opposite. Or they'll do what the Americans say, because that is the sole fountain of knowledge(!) I'd love for it to be a non-American.

No....I've already explained in my post. Because the Americans hold (and have held) a great degree of influence on such organisations. There needs to be a greater balance of power.

So? I'd like to know how much. As far as I know it is not the sole contributor. See my comment above regarding policies. Bad governance would lead to a change in any other organisation, so why not this one?

China is free of such intervention from WB and IMF and its doing just fine economically.

About 17% I believe. Only the EU and Japan are close. And the EU gets to appoint the head of the IMF.

You're blatantly ignoring the fact that the countries that need World Bank/IMF assistance are those who have massive problems to start with. They certainly wouldn't agree to conditions required by those organizations if they didn't want to. If anything, the reason so many World Bank programs have failed is because the World Bank wasn't able to force countries to abide by the terms of the contract.

No, the Washington Consensus was a disaster for the very reason that the countries adopted everything proposed by the IMF/WB because otherwise they would have economic sanctions imposed. Aid with a condition to do exactly what America/EU thinks right is a pretty crap deal but they have no choice.

Capital market and trade liberalisation was forced on the LDCs with no consideration for the high potential for failure. Sure, they now claim to have learned from mistakes, but whose economies were messed up?

Stiglitz is one of the few economists brave enough to stand up and say enough is enough - this isn't economics. Its politics.

Ignoring the obvious fact that the countries who were borrowing during the '90s (during the "Washington Consensus") are ones that destroyed their own economies in the '60s, '70s, and '80s. To blame the World Bank and the IMF for their prior failings is just ludicrous.

Bad governance previously by the respective governments does not excuse the supposedly 'wiser' policy makers in these institutions ****ing up big time. Speed of liberalisation was cherished above all and it serves them right that all the MDC capital got blown.

No, did I say they were the sole cause? They certainly contributed by harping on about policies that are nothing less than using the facade of aid to open up markets for developed countries to export manufactured goods, but refuse to do the same in the MDCs where these developing countries could gain an advantage in (agriculture, textiles etc.). Fair's fair - if the developing countries need to readjust their economies to match global competition, its about time the developed countries did the same.

Do you know what the World Bank and IMF are? They don't go randomly telling countries what to do. Their assistance is conditional upon the recipient country agreeing to certain terms. If countries don't ask for assistance, then they don't have to do anything.

Yes, I am well aware of their role in the world economy. I suggest you go find out.

The LDCs don't have any choice - they have to accept whatever aid they get. And when its conditional and tied to accepting policies that blatantly won't work, they're in a tight corner. Now until the developing countries get together and create their own fund to provide assistance that doesn't conform to American/Euro ideas of 'sound economics', there's little that can be done.

Why do you assume that the WB/IMF force policies that won't work onto these countries? Is it for ****s and giggles? Do you think they delight in making people poorer? Or is it that these policies do work, but it means a difficult transition to compensate for the destruction caused by prior non-market orientated policies? Economic liberalisation isn't an easy process, but is eventually a worthwhile one.

My question: how is the nomination made? Surely it's not as simple as Bush taking his pick?

</quote>

No, they don't work. Yes liberalisation is good. Pretty much everyone agrees on that. How its done is more important, however, and in this regard the WB/IMF have failed miserably. The policies became the end rather than the means. Stiglitz ('Globalisation and its Discontents') and Krugman ('Dutch Tulips and Emerging Markets') cover this in detail.

Its common knowledge that markets don't work perfectly in the real world but the policies implemented rely on the assumption that they do. Following the free market principle blindly never did much good - this lesson was learned decades ago in US and UK domestic policy - but it appears that they must be relearned again on the international scale as well.

Sachs sums it up really: "And for 20 years," he says, "the World Bank has been saying all you have to do is privatize, get government out of the markets, reduce the number of civil servants.and of course it had no effect at all because it was the wrong diagnosis. If you're going to do economic medicine make sure you give the right diagnosis."

More of a leadership coalition to determine appropriate policies. And actually listening to some economists for a start would help. I'm not saying they never have - just that its been done somewhat selectively.

They had a choice; not to take money from the World Bank and IMF. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> If you borrow money from a bank, you shouldn't complain about being forced to repay it.

According to the loony anti-globalization crowd, apparently being poor is an excuse to be excused from all of your obligations, and anyone who actually tries to enforce a contract that the poor party signed is being an evil and manipulative racist.

Girls and booze <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/five.gif" alt=":five:"/> That's how the student loan went (well, less girls and more booze) <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>

Assuming that the bank didn't advise you that spending the money on girls and booze would help you repay it in the future.

I didn't realize that the World Bank encouraged the leaders of poor countries to spend their loans on themselves and their families (and their supporters to an extent). Sure the Bank was responsible for some pretty disastrous projects, but the blame ultimately lies with the lender, as no one forced him to take the loan or to agree to its terms. And frankly, it's obvious that the poor countries chose which conditions they were going to respect; they certainly didn't carry out the ones that had to do with reducing corruption and red tape.

To be honest I thought it was quite obvious that I was alluding to the various failures throughout the years. The bank used to say "here, have this loan, spend it like this and you'll develop", now they say "here, have this loan on the condition that you do XYZ". The difference is purely technical; mainly because their advice has lost much of it's credibility.

I am not antiglobalisation - I just believe it should be done right, not to favour the rich countries via terms of trade. Secondly, are you defending the use of economic coercion? These institutions basically said you can have our loan, as long as you liberalise as we say (the wrong way as it turns out) and repay at ridiculous rates. Of course, if you refuse, the press will always say, country X refuses Western aid in an act of defiance.

Now, the ridiculous interest rates would not be a problem were the countries free to follow sensible economic policy, but the conditions of the loans ensure that ridiculous policies are put in place which pretty much give the countries no chance of paying it back.

So don't accuse anyone who opposes blind free marketism as an anti-globalist, because there are different brands of globalisation, and the one being acted out at the moment is pretty one sided.

Lets see. These institutions would have privatisation pushed through at any cost to keep the public industries out of the hands of corrupt politicians. But wait, who handles the privatisation? the very same corrupt leaders, which enables them to siphon off even more money than before, under the guise of 'sound policy'.

According to you, any failure of these economies is solely home grown, and any success is due to 'aid' from these institutions.

Besides, the flow of aid is tiny in comparison to the losses to the LDCs from unfair terms of trade. Fairer trade isn't that hard to achieve.

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/famine/story/0,12128,998666,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/famine/sto...998666,00.html</a> - Funny how this never makes the front page. No, because governments likes to revel in their 'generosity'. The CAP and US subsidies for agriculture etc. are some of the worst trade practices.

And don't bring up FairTrade products - they're an absolute disgrace to the idea of truly fair trade.

Good God, I might as well be looking in the mirror!

Seconded also on the 'FairTrade' products point. I can't count the number of times I've had to lecture people about them (even in the middle of the supermarket <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/> ).

Its such a profitable con...and I think the company was setup by various charities such as Oxfam etc. which is surprising considering these very same NGOs campaign for actual fair trade (lower trade barriers etc).
