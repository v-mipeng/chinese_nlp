"I kept my clothes on," Warren said, adding that she borrowed money to go to a public university and worked a part-time job.

So she thinks that because you worked your ass off making a decent living and risking your time and money to "build a factory" that you didn't pay taxes along the way? That you don't pay property taxes and sales taxes?

Obviously this is a person who never ran any kind of business.

Brown's first major gaffe of 2012 race

Scott Brown's reelection campaign isn't exactly starting out well. First his main strategist creates a fake Twitter account and gets caught red handed. Now, he makes fun of how his leading potential opponent looks.

The CrazyKhazei incident was bad but it was mostly inside baseball nonsense that nobody outside of political junkies and media really cared about. In 2012 it will be long forgotten. Making comments about the physical appearance of your leading potential opponent? Well, that's just stupid.

My take on this....both canidates had a humorus response to their questions, neither did anything wrong, and neither are making a big deal out of it.

Its the media and political groups that are trying to "make hay" out of the situation.

She took a jab at brown, brown took a jab back. End of story, no harm no foul.

I was once a big supporter of Brown, and voted for him in the special election.

But that was when I still thought he was an independent and that the best interests of his constituency was his top priority. Boy was I duped. His voting record clearly shows that he comfortably snuggled in the pocket of the big oil lobby. We have enough of those in Congress from other states, we don't need one from Massachusetts too.

Warren isn't my first choice, but I'll certainly vote for her over that phony douche Brown.

It's their thing. If you look at other "conservative" positions it's all about suffering for one reason or another.

It is actually because conservatives value working for and actually earning what they have. Liberals seem to see earning and equate that with suffering. Hmmm....

Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) Thursday said he was glad that one of his Democratic opponents, consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren, didn't "take her clothes off" to pay for college. Brown, who won his seat in a 2009 special election, was speaking on Boston radio station WZLX.

Brown made his comments when asked about Warren's response in a debate Tuesday to a question about how she paid for college. The question referenced the fact that Brown posed nude for Cosmopolitan in 1982 to make money.

"I kept my clothes on," Warren said, adding that she borrowed money to go to a public university and worked a part-time job.

No shit? I suppose the taxes that were paid by the employees probably helped out, you know, their income taxes, property taxes from the homes they bought, sales taxes from the goods they purchased with the money they made working at the factory, and then of course you have the businesses that built up to support those people who wanted to spend their money and all the people that work for those businesses and all the tax revenue that they represent. And it goes on and on and on........

Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) Thursday said he was glad that one of his Democratic opponents, consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren, didn't "take her clothes off" to pay for college. Brown, who won his seat in a 2009 special election, was speaking on Boston radio station WZLX.

Brown made his comments when asked about Warren's response in a debate Tuesday to a question about how she paid for college. The question referenced the fact that Brown posed nude for Cosmopolitan in 1982 to make money.

"I kept my clothes on," Warren said, adding that she borrowed money to go to a public university and worked a part-time job.

You see that won't work darling when you hear the original clip. In 2006 and even in 2008 I was begging people to use the new media to combat the moronic left wing that Axelrod was putting out there.

The original clip of this interchange has gone viral. As it should. Because the reality had nothing to do with Liz naked.

She took the first shot. Oh and I know in a liberal world that doesn't mean jack shit but in a conservative world it means everything.

She took the shot at Brown, he responded.

You will have to deal with it somewhere down the road. I don't think she's worth it.

What does, what Brown did way back in 1982 have to do with turning this economy around? It's amazing how the left again is taking focus off the economy, by talking about Brown's history. Brown should consistantly bring up where jobs and the unemployment numbers have gone during the time Obama and the Democrats had control, and force the Democrats to explain their lack of making jobs a priority until the Republicans took control of the House. Place the economy front and center to the American people, while the Democrats try to find other issues they'd rather talk about. ANYTHING but the party's record in Congress during the Obama administration.

If she wins, it will be another additional nail on the coffin as to why Obama and the Democrats couldn't bring unemployment back down. After all for the Democrats to start out at just over 7% BEFORE the $787 Billion stimulus, to now fighting to keep those numbers below 10%, doesn't look good no matter what "spin" the left tries to put on it. Brown is just one small battle in the fight to put America back to work, the Democrats have to come up with a LOT more "spin" to try and keep Obama's job in the White House.

To which I say: Get your panties out of your ass, unless its a thong, which would be physically impossible but you get my drift, and get a sense of humor. Have we as a nation become so unfunny and so beholden to pussyfooting (no pun intended) that weve lost our collective sense of humor?

Why do women need to be treated like such delicate flowers, anyway? If the fairer sex can dish it out, shouldnt we be able to take it? Women have scrutinized and made fun of Governor Chris Christies weight, former Senator and all-around deuche John Edwards hair, and Senator John Kerrys (alleged) Botox treatments, to name a few, yet we are incapable of handling a little joke about not wanting to see a 62-year-old woman naked?

I'm certain it was said in a joking overtone. Why is it we cannot have light hearted joking anymore? Or are only the left allowed this now? I'm sorry i simply don't get the memos like I used to.....

yup she intiated it by making a joke about how Brown posed nude for money for college (which is funny that a "liberal" would take issue with in and of itself) and then he made a joke by saying thank god she didn't get naked.

No big deal from either side in my opinion.

Both made fun of the other in a similar way and I think neither did anything wrong.

I'll humor you and explain it since I seem to confuse you very easily.

Its a joke that is being used to hammer at brown over posting naked (implying that his doing so has negatives attached to it, which is ironic from someone on the liberal side of issues)

Actually she did Dean. The person asking the questions at the debate asked the canidates "How did you afford to go to college" and warren responded "well at least I kept my clothes on"

She brought it up first. Not that it really matters but she did.
