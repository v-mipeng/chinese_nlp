Why just Libya? Why not Oman? Syria already has some deaths and if the demonstrations spread and Bashra-ul-Asad cracks down why not there? What about Bahrains's use of force. This action opens up a whole new door on the uprising's in the middle east and Africa. Will France lead the way?

Mission v Strategy?

"The mission is clearer than the strategy, and that strategy can’t be figured out from the first moves. The strategy might be the imposition of a no-fly zone, the imposition of a no-fly zone and attacks against Libya’s command-and-control centers, or these two plus direct ground attacks on Gadhafi’s forces.

" These could also be combined with an invasion and occupation of Libya.

"The question, therefore, is not the mission but the strategy to be pursued. How far is the coalition, or at least some of its members, prepared to go to effect regime change and manage the consequences following regime change? How many resources are they prepared to provide and how long are they prepared to fight?

"It should be remembered that in Iraq and Afghanistan the occupation became the heart of the war, and regime change was merely the opening act. It is possible that the coalition partners haven’t decided on the strategy yet, or may not be in agreement..."

churchill said that degaulle was almost as big of an obstacle as hitler himself.
i like the guy (girl) that told me to "read up on my history".

don't worry sir, i don't really think that sarkosy is a boy king. (maybe berlusconi from italy) i know that france is no longer a monarchy.
and yes i liked marie antionette (after she lost her head.)

the reason i hate france is because, like many european countries, until now, there responsibility and involvement of world affairs ended at their own border. they basked in the comfort of freedom provided at our expense, at the same time, condemning us for it.

but here's the thing.... are the democrats and the press going to admonish their president of obama for starting a new war in a country that has not attacted us, or that has no weapons of mass destruction. are our troops involved "american mercenaries" like they were for president bush.
what business do we have there. ?

if you apply the same criteria, how do you justify involing the u.s. in someone elses civil war. will we see rallies in the streets. how is this different. i'm looking forward to what tools you will use to rationalize u.s. involvement. will cindy sheehan camp out in front of the hawaii hilton to protest obama ?

how is gadaffi so different from saddam? will we see the great demonstartive drama that we saw with iraq? or is it ok because it's obama this time, do the moral values and ethics change because the media is in bed with this president, a democrat ?

even the name "odessey dawn", seems romantic and fun. they should have called it "double standard". i hope people revist the "justifications and decisions for the iraq freedom campaign. president obama may think he invented "the well defined goal", but it's been around for a while.

But, are they leading? And, who is leading what and to what ends? So many questions, but no answers. Of course there's another minor detail from this most blissful endeavor that has been wrapped up into a nice little tidy humanitarian bouquet of love and flowers......so sweetly crude.

May 7, 1954.......Vietnamese forces occupy the French command post at Dien Bien Phu and the French commander orders his troops to cease fire. The battle had lasted 55 days. Three thousand French troops were killed, 8,000 wounded. The Viet Minh suffered much worse, with 8,000 dead and 12,000 wounded, but the Vietnamese victory shattered France's resolve to carry on the war.

Nope. Class cannot be dimissed as long as you keep posting fallacies.

Before you start pointing too many fingers I suggest you research U.S. isolationist policies prior to WWI. We would also fit the object of your scorn.

Then you can reflect on the fact that I never once said France was not in Vietnam in the 1850's, now did I? I just merely reminded you that France was there in the 1950's, contrary to your mistaken belief that the 1850's was the last time.

OK....you may now go on with your irrational hatred of an entire nation based on fallacies and half truths.

</quote>

The Arab League (not Arab Nation - they aren't a nation - they are a group of nations), supports the UN action.

The head of the Arab League has been quoted as disapproving of the airstrikes. However, it appears, according to British media, that he has explained this as a mis-translation between Arabic and English. He voiced concern over the potential civilian casualties - and he voiced that concern in response to a direct question about the potential for civilian casualties. I think it's an important context... The Arab League are on board with the UN action, there is no split in the coalition (according to the media).

The Arab league is playing to the masses. Secretly they are very pleased about this. Qaddafi tried to take out King Abdullah over a slight insult a few years back.

They don't like him and they want him out.

</quote>

Actually, they're pissed at the bombing - they seem to be concerned that civilians might get killed.

Oh, and.... it's not just the French who are leading... the Brits are too. And some of those airstrikes... yep, that'll be the RAF. Yay for them.

</quote>

No they ain't. They could give 2 shits about civilians. The "Arab League" are, for the most part, a bunch of dictators and despots clinging to power. And they are cowards.

That explains why Obama wanted them to sign off on this before he went in, and look how long it took them to stab us in the back.

How Authoritative is PNAC?

"The 2000 Report of the Project of the New American Century entitled 'Rebuilding Americas' Defenses' calls for the implementation of a long war, a war of conquest.

"One of the main components of this military agenda is: to 'Fight and decisively win in multiple, simultaneous theater wars'.

' Operation Libya' is part of that process.

"It is another theater in the Pentagon's logic of 'simultaneous theater wars'.

"The PNAC document faithfully reflects the evolution of US military doctrine since 2001. The US plans to be involved simultaneously in several war theaters in different regions of the World.

"While protecting America, namely 'National Security' of the United States of America is upheld as an objective, the PNAC report does spell out why these multiple theater wars are required. The humanitarian justification is not mentioned.

"What is the purpose of America's military roadmap?

" Libya is targeted because it is one among several remaining countries outside America's sphere of influence, which fail to conform to US demands...

"In the words of former NATO Commander Chief General Wesley Clark:

"'in the Pentagon in November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said.

"'But there was more.

"'This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Somalia and Sudan.... (Wesley Clark, Winning Modern Wars, p. 130). '"

Maybe that five year plan's a little behind schedule?

Generally, the Brit media is a damned sight more accurate than ours. Turns out, they were correct. The Arab League has issued a statement to correct the inaccuracy.

The Arab League (not Arab Nation - they aren't a nation - they are a group of nations), supports the UN action.

The head of the Arab League has been quoted as disapproving of the airstrikes. However, it appears, according to British media, that he has explained this as a mis-translation between Arabic and English. He voiced concern over the potential civilian casualties - and he voiced that concern in response to a direct question about the potential for civilian casualties. I think it's an important context... The Arab League are on board with the UN action, there is no split in the coalition (according to the media).

</quote>

Yasser Arafat used to have the same problem with translations. He would kiss up to the US in English and say something in Arabic that was more along the lines of us being evil and deserved to be wiped out. Arabic seems to be a very difficult language to translate properly.

Couldn't agree more.

We have enough on our plate right now. Let the Britts and the French lead the way.

I'm sure we are providing logistic support. We also have Naval vessels offshore if needed.

Hope Quadaffi gets killed in the process. Couldn't happen to a nicer dirtbag.

i would add that my disdain for france goes back to degaulle and ww2. it also reaches across europe to switzerland (small s), for the expression "hey !.. we're switzerland". fuck you switzerland, you are not great, you are merely dependent. when the islamic radicals blow up bern... i shall think...
