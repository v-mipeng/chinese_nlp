<P>
Houston Rockets guard Tracy McGrady will switch jersey numbers next season to
help raise awareness for his Darfur humanitarian project, the National
Basketball Association team said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
McGrady, who along with injured Chinese star centre Yao Ming formed the backbone
of Houston's attack, will surrender his No. 1 jersey to new teammate Trevor
Ariza, a swingman.
</P>
<P>
McGrady, who could miss up to the first half of next season while recovering
from left knee surgery, also wore No. 3 while at high school.
</P>
<P>
McGrady hopes to raise attention for the "3 Points" documentary film that will
debut in America later this year, a movie chronicling his 2007 journey to Darfur
refugee camps in Chad.
</P>
<P>
The "3 Points" refer to the goals of peace, protection and punishment in Darfur,
with McGrady seeking peace and protection for those forced into camps and
punishment for those involved in the Darfur violence.
</P>
<P>
China, whose leaders have agreed to allow Yao to play in the NBA alongside
McGrady, has been criticized for supporting the government in the conflict that
has overtaken the region.
</P>
<P>
McGrady also has donated 75,000 dollars toward constructing a school in a
refugee camp in eastern Chad.
