The A2K World Cup 2006 Striker Fantasy Game
</headline>
<post author="fbaezer" datetime="2006-05-25T18:58:00" id="p1">
The Football (soccer) World Cup in Germany starts in 2 weeks.
It's time to play another A2K Fantasy Game.

The simple rules of the game:

1. Each participant chooses 5 footballers who will play in Germany 2006, and orders them from 1 to 5.

2. Every goal scored from this players will mean points to the participant. 5 points for player number 1; 4 points for player number 2; 3 points for player number 3; 2 points for player number 4 and 1 point for player number 5.

3. The game will be held in 3 stages:
Stage 1: group rounds - first 48 games
Stage 2: second round and quarter finals - 12 games
Stage 3: semi-finals, game for 3rd place and final - 4 games

4. The list of strikers for Stage 1, and their order, can be changed for Stage 2 and, again, for Stage 3. If a new list is not provided before a stage kick-off, the original list will be taken as confirmed for that stage.

5. The winner is the participant who scores the most points.

6. There will be 4 winners. One for each stage and one for the total tournament.

7. Tiebreak system:
If two or more players end a stage or the tournament with the same number of points, the tie break will follow this criteria:
I. The participant whose strikers scored more goals, regardless of the order in the list.
II. The participant whose strikers scored more headers (goals with the head).
III. The participant whose strikers scored less goals from penalty kicks. (the eleven step PK).

8. No player can duplicate a previous poster team. There should be at least one difference (in the order or in the list itself).

Prizes:
Stage winners: Virtual gold medal
Tournament winner: Virtual FIFA Cup
Tournament runner-up: Virtual silver cup.

I'm gambling on certain players making hay in the earlier games aganst the so-called weaker nations. For example, England and Sweden should score plenty of goals against Trinidad and Tobago, while I'd expect Switzerland and South Korea to inflict similar damage on Togo.

Henrik Larsson (Sweden)

Well, I think that with this game in mind you might learn a lil' bit about the game George. And if you don't, its anyway fun.

And talking about not knowing so much about soccer, there's some research from some guy in Berlin that found out that people that know a little bit about soccer were as good as "experts" in predicting the outcome of the last Euro Cup.

And totally off-topic and for those who can read spanish I wrote in my blog about my experience in the first day of the world cup (WC) in a little university town in Germany:

Well, this day wasn´t great but I would love to change Larsson for Robben. That guy wanted all the balls for himself, and if he achieves in scoring a couple more he will get a lot more passes. On the other hand Larsson seemed shy with the ball, not the same as I saw in the champiions League.

5. sheo_mac 2 points

Never seen Luca Toni play (only in my Panini album); tonight at 9 will be a quite interesting game. I believe, though I'm not sure, that almost the same Ghana team crushed Italy 4 to 0 in the 2000 Olympics. Does anyone knows knows more about this?

Oh, all right, Ellpus. I haven't won anything since the camera at my friend's photo store opening, I didn't even accept it, whatta dummy, wanting the store to do ok...

These are the numbers not to pick - 4, 19, 23, 31, 45, 46. Those all seem like terrible numbers that don't ring any bells to me...

I just found out that I can't win this phase.

If my Adriano scores, Lord Ellpus will get 3 more points than me for each goal.

If Shevchenko scores, I only recover 1 point from both Pantalones and Patada Veloz, and I'm behind by 8 points. No way Shevchenko can score 9 goals in a game (and that's supposing El Niño can't get any).

----

George needs Crespo to do a double, and Pauleta too (let's hope not), he has slightly more chances than myself, but it'll be hard for him to leave the pack.
Sheo_mac and ossobuco need a hat trick from Van Nistelrooj, or at least a couple, plus assorted goals by Pauleta (God forbid!), Raúl or Gilardino. From improbable to impossible.
Imur needs Frei and Shun-soo to go wild on their game. His chances for this round are also very slim.
hingehead needs Fonseca to score a couple (please, God!), Ronaldo and Raúl to do the same and Baros and Babel to play and show their stuff. Also doomed, IMHO.

---

So the deal is between Patada Veloz, Pantalones &amp; Lord Ellpus.
The key for Patada Veloz is Torres NOT to score. A goal by Baros or Ronaldinho would be additional help, but not crucial.
The key for Pantalones is Torres to score. A goal by Henry can make him surpass Patada, but would help Lord Ellpus even more.
The key player for Ellpus is Adriano. One goal by the Brazilian, and the English Lord is on the lead. Toni can be of marginal help. And Ellpus must pray that neither Shevchenko nor Torres score against those mighty moors.

About the rules of the game, a reminder:

"3. The game will be held in 3 stages:
Stage 1: group rounds - first 48 games
Stage 2: second round and quarter finals - 12 games
Stage 3: semi-finals, game for 3rd place and final - 4 games

4. The list of strikers for Stage 1, and their order, can be changed for Stage 2 and, again, for Stage 3. If a new list is not provided before a stage kick-off, the original list will be taken as confirmed for that stage. "

This means you can change your strikers until before the start of the game between Germany and Sweden.
You can get rid of your eliminated, injured or out-of-key player, change the order, get even, etc.
The game is open for any newcomer (who can certainly win a stage, but has a handicap against for the whole tournament points).

The window for changes is open now (they will not take effect until Saturday June 24th).

Strange indeed. And not healthy.

Some pollsters say that the football squad may help decide a very close election.

The election is on July 2nd. If the team is still alive, it will help the incumbent party.
Several football players and ex-players, led by Fonseca, have contributed to the "Mexico Winner" campaign of the conservatives. The populist candidate, the main contender, instead, focuses on the things that lack in our country... and likes baseball.
Coach Lavolpe reacted by declaring that "Kikin" (Fonseca) reads tabloids and doesn't know what he says. It caused a stir right before the tournament.
It was only Borgetti's injury and Franco's terrible performances that forced Lavolpe to start Fonseca (even if he, not Bravo, was considered the natural companion of Borgetti in Mexico's offense).

One small question. Though Schevchenko didn't score his penalty kick, What about the strikers that do? Would those goals be tallied or not? My confusion arose from looking at the world cup web page, there they say that the last striker was Totti, <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/es/index.html">World Cup</a> (sorry guys, the link is to the Spanish version).
Personally I believe that the PK goals should be tallied (I actually chose my guys because I believe that if there are PK they will shoot one;).

<post author="hingehead" datetime="2006-06-27T02:02:00" id="p130">
Totti's was in general play and should count - any scored in a penalty shoot out (after extra time) should not count.

While leading the overall board, Patada Veloz hasn't been able to grab a phase. Nor he will this time.

My key man is Rooney. Lord Ellpus needs two goals by Henry. Or else, Rabbit George won't be surpassed in Phase II.

I can still win the phase, right? Crouch only needs to score 6 goals. He CAN do it, right? I mean... he's like 6'7 or something he could just juggle the ball with his head from midfield and noone could do anything about it, except the keeper but then he would just shoot the ball over him when the keeper comes out. It IS possible, right?

My five for the final round are......

4. Klose
5. Ribery

I was going to choose Maniche and Ronaldo, but was afraid that they would dive in order to achieve their goals, and I would hate to win on that basis.

France must be favourites now after their terrific performances against Spain and, especially, Brazil.

I'd really love to see Zidane go out on a high. And he did score twice in the final of '98, not to mention the winner in the Champions League final.

So:

Zidane
Podolski
Henry
Pauleta (hat trick in the 3rd place play-off!)
Toni (will match Pauleta's feat!)

Hopefully, the semis and final will be equally as exciting as this thread!!

Klose (because he can't help scoring)

Ronaldo (sooner or later he has to deliver on his promise)
Ballack (my dark horse)
Totti (the Italian flying squad will give him at least a couple of penalties)

my guys:

Klose. Opportunistic
Zizou. On fire
Henry. Terrific player
Podolski. Klinsi loves him
Toni. He might score

And now, though no one asked me, my predictions:
Italy-Germany will be a really close game, probably will end in a 2-2 and will be defined on PK.
Portugal France will be a great game, if Zizou plays as beautiful as vs. Brazil it will be even nicer and they'll beat the lusitans.
Germany will beat France in the final, but I hope it will be super nice game.
Portugal will beat the disilussioned italians in a yet another amazingly boring game by the portuguese for the 3rd place.

Hmm, birdbrain picked a midfielder for one of her fantasy strikers - that comes from looking at lists without knowledge. However, birdbrain's choice, Pirlo, did get player of the match on the FIFA site.

I wouldn't stress osso - who would have picked Grosso (Italy's left fullback) to score - and brilliantly...., and I don't think anyone had del Piero.

If no one gets any points in this round do we have a penalty shoot out to decide the winner?

<post author="fbaezer" datetime="2006-07-04T17:41:00" id="p158">
Pirlo was (and is) an excellent pick, osso.
He had a better chance to score today than so-called strikers Toni and Gilardino. And was much much closer than Klose.

All this as I sing "aleé-o-o... aleé-o-o"

It seems that I'm quite "jynxed", my girlfriend is starting to bet on the opposite team that I believe will win. If my streak goes on she might get rich!

...nor I can believe that Portugal made it to the semis; nor the germans -yes, the germans- believed that they would made it to this level.

About Goethe, the legend says that he was invited to stay here in Tuebingen for a while, something similar to a sabatic, but on the very first day that he was walking around he couldn't stand the smell of the open channels and did what he had to do.
