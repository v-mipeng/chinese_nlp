****, I'm wondering how much Kim ir Sen, Kim il Jong and his fat slanty-eyed kids paid to the Olympic committee to get this???

Anyone going there will probably be shot and their bodies boiled with dogs, or whatever else these commie bastards devour there.

Anyone tell me how the hell did this happen? When I read this I sat like an idiot trying to realise if this was a joke or not.

Krazy....

I'm assuming you're trolling. Should that be hoping?

Pyeongchang is in SOUTH KOREA.

Kim Jong Il is the leader of NORTH KOREA.

THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE COUNTRIES.

1) It's Pyeongchang. Surely if you linked the article, this means you read it, and could spell the place name right.

2) You seem to have misunderstood and are talking about completely the wrong country.

Also, this isn't half as bad as Russia being allowed to have the World Cup, I think more people are likely to get shot there especially given the growing neo-nazi movement over there.

Even if Pengyang was the capital of North Korea (which it isn't), the Olympics aren't being held there, they are being held in Pyeongchang. So still a fail on your part.
