Levin and Stabenow back Sun Country's application for route

<P>
Washington - Four senators are urging the U.S. Transportation
Department to approve direct flights from Michigan's capital to the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
Sun Country Airlines has applied for an unused gate at
Washington, D.C.'s, Ronald Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
The airline would use the slot to fly between Washington and
Lansing, with continuing service to Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Democratic U.S. Sens. Carl Levin of Detroit and Debbie Stabenow
of Lansing, as well as Minnesota Democratic U.S. Sens. Amy
Klobuchar and Al Franken, wrote Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood
seeking his approval of the request by the Minnesota-based low-cost
airline.
</P>
<P>
Approval "would save travelers millions of dollars in lower
fares" for travelers in Minnesota and Michigan, they said.
</P>
<P>
In June, the airline said it would launch service Dec. 22 from
Lansing to Las Vegas; Ft. Myers and Orlando, Fla.; Cancun, Mexico;
and Montego Bay, Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
The senators said approving the service could boost economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"The Lansing region caters to state and federal agencies,
nonprofit organizations and many growing businesses that require
transportation to D.C. as a part of their professions. It is
inconvenient that Lansing, as the capital of Michigan, currently
lacks a direct flight to Washington, D.C.," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Lansing is a convenient terminal for the 90 percent of
Michigan residents who live within 90 minutes of the city. Michigan
travelers would clearly benefit from the competition and reduction
in airfare provided by Sun Country."
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
Other carriers, including Southwest Airlines and US Airways,
also are vying for the two open slots at Reagan National Airport.
