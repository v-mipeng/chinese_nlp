Give one example in recent history where people were led to war for reasons other then freedom, liberation etc. I want to know. because from the way I know, all wars were fought with "good intentions" given to the society. it's always to "liberate" someone or to "defend against someones threat"

I have never heard of any dictator or leader taking his people into war to another country in order to "steal their goods, repossess their women" have you? please share.

Other way I am absolutely convinced 100%, that all pro war people are anti Christ: just because a black man wears a white suit, does not mean he is a white man

Did your school teach you about 1991 INVASION of Kuwait by Iraq and
then the resumption of the 1991 War in Iraq in 2003 when during the 12 years from when Saddam SIGNED the 1991 CEASE FIRE he continued to murder his own people, build WMDs and attacked over 1,000 times coalition aircraft?
Thus resulting in the RESUMPTION in Mar 2003 of the WAR in IRAQ BECAUSE SADDAM
completely broke his 1991 CEASE FIRE agreement?

ARE You truly that ignorant of history?

I understand history and I recognize bullshit.

Bush Sr. was right to drive Saddam from Kuwait after other Arab states requested US help.

But as for the rest. Look at it this way. If you punched someone in the eye, would you walk away and turn your back on them and ignore them? Only if you're an idiot.

Bush Sr. had been the head of the CIA, an officer in WWII, Vice President and President. To believe that after forcing Saddam back to Iraqi borders and that he would then ignore Saddam is downright stupid. And I'm talking seriously stupid.

You know he parked at least a half dozen spy satellites permanently stationed over Iraq. The country was under sanctions. Their military had been destroyed. They had no industry. No manufacturing. No resources beyond oil and Iraq is a small country.

Imagining this guy was a big threat is wildly insane and laughable.

No it wasn't. The immediate reason given was because of some fake incident the Nazis stage in the Polish Corridor. The reason for invading Eastward was lebenstraum (living space).

Nope. That isn't the reason Lincoln gave for invading the South. He said it was to enforce his hated tariffs. "Lincoln never gave the slightest indication that he wanted to end slavery. His "preserve the union" shtick was pure propaganda.

One thing about lefties is that they always have the liberal media to cover their criminal asses. You could make the case that the motivation for Korea and VietNam was legitimate. In both cases an innocent country was invaded. You could also make a case that the operations were illegal. Truman never consulted congress and LBJ invented a crisis in the Gulf of Tonkin that wasn't real. You could also make a case that both conflicts were so grossly mismanaged that it borders on criminal behavior. The liberal media turned Truman into a hero and forgot about LBJ's role in the Gulf of Tonkin. On the other hand the liberal media complains about Iraq when the president consulted congress and waited almost a year before committing Troops to a conflict that was run brilliantly even though democrats tried to undermine it at every step.

Didn't a US official tell Saddam back before he invaded Kawait that we don't get involved in Arab on Arab conflicts?

If the debt truly matters to you, then we need to stop fighting wars so Shell can profit on Iraq's oil, especially when they don't even share the profits with the US Citizens who pay the bill for their invasions.

And so Cocacola can sell their shit overseas.

Ron Paul's right about one thing.

Yeah, "good link" if you're a total nutburger. That sight has got to be one of the most distant from reality I've ever seen. Allow me to quote from its mission statement:

<quote>
PROUT stands for PROgressive UTilization Theory. It means, the progressive utilization and rational distribution of all the earth's natural resources. PROUT advocates another type of revolution called "nuclear revolution." In nuclear revolution, every aspect of collective life - social, economic, political, cultural, psychic and spiritual - is completely transformed. New moral and spiritual values arise in society which provide the impetus for accelerated social progress. The old era is replaced by a new era - one collective psychology is replaced by another. This type of revolution results in all-round development and social progress.

BINGO!

To be more specific, the Southern states did not want Northern merchantilists like Lincoln imposing massive tariffs on them. Just before Lincoln was inaugurated, Buchanon signed the "Tariff of Abomination" which drastically increased tariffs.
