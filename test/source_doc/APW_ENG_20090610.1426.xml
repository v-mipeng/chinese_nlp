For devoted Boston Globe readers, it's bad enough that the 137-year-old newspaper has a murky future. Even worse: The fate of the paper will be decided by a bunch of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
After all, locals see Boston as a nucleus of culture and education -- outsiders call it Beantown, but residents call it "The Hub," as in the hub of the universe. And they loathe conceding anything to the metropolis to the south.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the clash between Boston and New York is played out in the most celebrated rivalry in U.S. sports: on the baseball diamond between the Red Sox and Yankees, who meet at Fenway this week. But the Globe's big problems have nothing to do with sports.
</P>
<P>
The Globe's parent New York Times Co. has promised to slash wages by 23 percent after the Globe's biggest union rejected deep cuts in pay and benefits and is also reportedly looking to sell the paper, and it seems the company could follow through on a threat to close the Globe "at a whim," Boston historian Thomas O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
"In many respects, it's embarrassing that New York is in the catbird's seat now," said O'Connor, author of several books on Boston history, including "Athens of America."
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said the rivalry between the two cities existed long before baseball. Boston, once home to writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Nathaniel Hawthorne, was "the literary capital of the nation" in the mid-1800s. But by the early 1900s many famous writers, as well as major literary publications and publishing companies, had abandoned Boston for New York.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Boston's media landscape has been shrinking. The Atlantic magazine, which began in 1857 back in Boston's literary heyday, moved to Washington in 2005. Other magazines that started in Boston, like the business publication Fast Company, have moved to New York.
</P>
<P>
Callie Crossley, a commentator and media analyst from Harvard University, said perceptions that a New York company is ruining the Globe feed the same attitude that can make a Red Sox win over the Yankees about more than baseball. Or, in her words, "Take that, you snobbish New York people. We can beat you."
</P>
<P>
"I do think there is some of that attitude going on here. You know: 'You always think that we're nothing, so instead of competing honestly and instead of negotiating in good faith, you stomp on us,'" Crossley said.
</P>
<P>
The Globe's problems, and the Times' apparent indifference to the fate of a treasured and vital Boston institution, have transferred some of the rivalry's rancor off field, even if it's "in our minds only," said Emily Rooney, executive editor of "Beat the Press," a media criticism show on Boston's PBS affiliate.
</P>
<P>
"New York outscales us on every metric, and I think it just fosters a sense of inadequacy or kind of inferiority, and this is clearly part of it, the fact that our newspaper doesn't matter and theirs does," Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
The struggling New York Times Co. says its dire actions are a matter of necessity at a paper that will lose $85 million this year. The Globe, citing two anonymous potential buyers, reported Wednesday that the Times has hired Goldman Sachs to manage a possible sale of the paper.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman of Times Co., has said "I do love the Globe," but some locals haven't seen a lot of love in his management. Former Globe columnist Eileen McNamara, who accepted a buyout at the Globe in 2007, blasted the Times for treating "New England's largest newspaper like a cheap whore."
</P>
<P>
"It pimped her out for profit during the booming 1990s and then pillaged her when times got tough," she wrote in a column in the Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
Sulzberger, responding to a letter from Globe reporters asking for his intervention in the contract dispute, said Wednesday the company was forced to cut wages after the Guild rejected the contract offer.
</P>
<P>
"Without that, the Globe will be unable to effectuate the savings already ratified by its other unions, in which case it simply cannot survive," he wrote. "We cannot allow that to happen, so we, regrettably, will implement the wage reduction."
</P>
<P>
Globe workers who voted against the contract on Monday said the company hasn't played it straight during talks, demanding onerous cuts without attempting to negotiate more reasonable reductions or requiring managers to make similar sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone sees the Globe's travails under the tint of a New York-Boston beef. Former Boston Mayor Ray Flynn said he has no resentment about the Times' decisions, saying they're "just economics" in an awful financial climate for newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Shepard, dean of the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism, says it's "ridiculous" to color the Globe-Times dealings with a rivalry between the cities that he says exists solely in sports.
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard anyone wish ill to The Boston Globe," he said. "The Red Sox, yes. The Boston Globe, no."
