Elvis Presley fans are descending on Graceland for a late night procession past the king of rock 'n' roll's grave in Memphis.

Presley died at his Graceland mansion Aug. 16, 1977. The candlelight vigil remembering his life is the highlight of a weeklong series of fan-club meetings, movies and Elvis-impersonator contests.

Fans arriving early set up chairs to mark their place in line, then visited water stations to seek refuge from 100-degree (37.78-Celsius) temperatures.

The procession usually attracts several thousand participants and runs into the morning hours.
