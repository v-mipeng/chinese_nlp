<P>
The Dutch Antilles will stop existing from Sunday when two of its islands become
independent states in the Kingdom of the Netherlands and three become Dutch
municipalities under a pact concluded last month.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Netherlands and its former colonies, the five-island Antilles and
the neighbouring Caribbean isle of Aruba, were independent member countries of
the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
But under the new deal, the Antillean islands of Curacao and St Maarten will
become independent states in the Kingdom, while Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatius
will become Dutch municipalities
</P>
<P>
"After midnight on Saturday, the country known as the Dutch Antilles will no
longer exist," Dutch interior ministry spokesman Thijs Manten told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The composition of the Kingdom of the Netherlands will change."
</P>
<P>
From Sunday, the kingdom will consist of the Netherlands, Aruba and the two
largest ex-Antillean islands: Curacao with about 150,000 inhabitants and St
Maarten with about 40,000
</P>
<P>
The islands of Bonaire, Saba, and St Eustatius, with less than 20,000
inhabitants between them, will become special-status Dutch municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The changes reflect the wishes of a majority of voters in referenda held on the
islands, leading to the signing of a final pact by the Antilles, the Netherlands
and Aruba on September 9.
</P>
<P>
Curacao and St Maarten will each have their own parliament, government, prime
minister and currency: the guilder.
</P>
<P>
Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatius will switch to the US dollar and have "island
councils" akin to municipal councils. Their inhabitants will vote for the
national Dutch government.
</P>
<P>
The three new municipalities will have to adopt many Dutch laws. The most
contentious among them, allowing for abortion, gay marriage and euthanasia, will
be systematically adopted over a period of two years, said Manten.
</P>
<P>
"The big benefit of all this is that a country that did not function properly
(the Antilles) will stop existing," he added. "It will free the islands from a
lot of debt and allow them to make a fresh start, creating space for new policy
formulation and spending on things like health and education."
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the Dutch government would take over 70 percent of the debt of
the Antilles, estimated at some 1.7 billion euros (2.4 billion dollars).
