I live in Ocean County, I've been here almost 3 years now. There are things I love (people down here are so relaxed compared with the cities I've lived in!), and things that drive me crazy (NJ drivers are insane!) It's bizarre because I would never in a million years have ever expected to live here, but it's where we ended up for DH's job and we're really happy here.

I have family that lives in Lakewood and if you live in NJ you have to go to Ocean County some time during the summer (Ocean and all). It's funny b/c DH and I said if we ever move it would be to Canada (Montreal to be specific).

Yeah, weekend traffic is horrendous. We try to arrive during the week and it's not too bad and then once we're there, we walk everywhere. I love it.. SO much different than the picture of the Jersey Shore that most people automatically think of!

You need to add "Southeast," because while I live in the south - North Carolina, I don't live in Alabama, Mississippi or Georgia (where I consider the "south"). Plus, I live on the east coast. So I need a Southeast option to really show where I live.
