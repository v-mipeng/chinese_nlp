The loss to the Communists in China's civil war in the 1940's was the biggest
setback and humiliation for former Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek,
according to the entries in his diary.
</P>
<P>
After relocating his government to Taiwan in 1949, Chiang spent a lot of his
time in "thorough soul-searching", trying to understand why only four years
after winning a hard war against Japanese invaders in World War II, his
Nationalist forces yielded the Chinese mainland to the Communist army, the diary
shows.
</P>
<P>
"The root causes, among other things, were putting the wrong persons in wrong
positions," Chiang wrote.
</P>
<P>
Two such examples were naming Soong Tse-ven as premier and General Pai Chung-hsi
as his top military aide, Chiang reflected.
</P>
<P>
Soong failed to adequately address the problematic economy, and Pai failed to
stop the communists from advancing, Chiang said in the diary.
</P>
<P>
The diaries of Generalissimo Chiang and his son, the late President Chiang
Ching-kuo, are now on display at the Hoover Institute, Stanford University in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shao Ming-huang, director of the Kuomintang's Party History Hall, said Wednesday
that the senior Chiang wrote in his diary every day for more than 50 years
between 1917 and 1972. This was a reflection of his one of his personal
characteristics  of "perseverance" throughout life, Shao added.
</P>
<P>
The 55-volume diary of the senior Chiang, written in Chinese calligraphy,
touched on a wide range of matters such as national and party affairs, the
international situation, personnel disputes within the Nationalists government,
the China civil war, cross-Taiwan Strait confrontations, family affairs and
Chiang's romances, said Shao, who visited the U.S. to read the diaries before
they went on display.
</P>
<P>
Shao said that the senior Chiang used to keep a diary as a means of "examining
himself" and correcting his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Generalissimo Chiang, who died in 1975 in Taiwan, never tried to hide his
personal feelings toward anyone, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
The Generalissimo once intentionally called U.S. General George Catlett Marshall
"Ma Hsia-er", a contemptuous name in Chinese that implied the general was the
son of an indecent Marshall family.
</P>
<P>
Marshall was a five-star general sent by then U.S. President Harry Truman in
1945 to broker a proposed  Chinese coalition government between the Nationalists
and Communists. But Chiang thought General Marshall had favored Mao Zedong,
leader of the Communist forces, and that the Nationalists' failure was linked to
that.
</P>
<P>
When he learned of Marshall's death from a stroke in 1959, Chiang wrote "Ma
Hsia-er just got the punishment he deserved."
</P>
<P>
Shao said the diary showed that the senior Chiang "went beyond the general
impression of being just a general, as he never tired of reading in his
lifetime."
</P>
<P>
Chiang's personality underwent a lot of changes during the last years of his
life, and his temper softened as he grew older, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that did not change was his determination to 'recover the
Chinese mainland' -- a dream that failed to come true before he died," Shao
said.
