Because the wealth of the country, as in many other countries, fails to find its way down to the very poorest in society. The increased wealth leads to massive social inequality - 'making the rich richer' - rather than being used to create a system that allows the possibility of economic equality.

Because it is a developing country..! It has a high aggregate GDP - but this is a nation of over one billion people.

It also has rising income inequality that makes the USA look like a socialist utopia.

There's poverty everywhere, no country in the world has no poverty, it's because of uneven distribution of money, where the rich get richer, and the poor, merely become poorer ) : Meh.. stupid capitalism.

It's got about the same amount of GDP as Japan yet more than 10 times it's population. It's going to get much better in about 30-50 years time though.

Never said China was a capitalist country, I was just talking about capitalism, which was irrelevant to this conversation.

Last I checked the Communist Party of China was in power. But go ahead and correct me. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Judging the political philosophy of a country by its name.

Does not...compute...

North Korea = The Democratic People's Republic of Korea = Democracy? People's republic? Republic?

No need to roll eyes mate. Might want to take a look at the principles of communism and the state of China and see if they match up. If only the world was a simple as the name matching the content.

Well I'm basing my thoughts of their politics by the name of the party in charge, as far as I know (and care in all honesty) China has been a communist country for a good 50 years if not more.

One thing I am sick of though is idiots blaming capitalism for the worlds issues, despite the fact that no country has ever and will ever be a purely capitalist state (and governments injecting massive amounts of money into collapsing banks is not a capitalist move), just like I imagine no country has ever and will ever be a purely communist state.

Actually, there's never been a Communist country in history. People only identify a Communist country by the there being a Communist Party in charge. That's the way it's always been.

If you think that China is a communist country, you are very mistaken.

But, it hasn't been a communist country for 50 years. It's changed dramatically, namely Mao died. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/eek.gif" alt=":eek:"/> State capitalism can seem like communism/socialism so I can understand your confusion. But, I can assure you that it isn't a communist state.

That's why I criticized you. You have capitalist who state that there has never been a capitalist country yet criticize "communist" countries and think it criticizes communism. And then you communist who criticize "capitalist" countries and think it criticizes capitalism. Then you have people like me who can see both of you guys are right.

Amongst other reasons there is an unbelievable amount of corruption within the CCP bureaucratic machine which governs China.

In capitalism, as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

In communism, as the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

China isn't really communist.

High population, to name one reason.

For those who want to know about the actual economic system in China, it is a socialist market economy - known officially by the PRC as "socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics" since the reforms of Deng Xiaoping and it consists of a mixture of economic planning with a market economy.

Because of the amount of people. If the USA had 1.2+ billion people, its situation would be no different.

Perhaps the USA should aim to attract around 300 million in the coming decades to compete?

(I'm not joking by the way)

Same reason why there is poverty in the USA as well.

<post author="Mcnubn" datetime="2011-12-07T19:50:00" id="p26">
another contributing factor would be that the majority of the low skilled employment that makes our stuff is concentrated along the coast, which does attract huge amounts of migrant workers, but those left at home are still below the poverty line

although i believe in the most recent 5 year plan, they mentioned that they are aiming to move more of the jobs further inland...atleast thats what they were raving about when i was there last year
