<P>
Hundreds of rescuers headed for quake-hit Yushu are stranded at Xining airport
of northwest China's Qinghai Province due to heavy snow in Yushu and a sandstorm
in Xining, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The air route from Xining Caojiabao Airport to Yushu was recently dubbed as
"lifeline of the air" as it was vitally important for getting immediate relief
and rescuers to Yushu, which was jolted by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake on April
14.
</P>
<P>
All the six daily flights from Xining to Yushu were delayed, said a spokesperson
with Caojiabao Airport.

<P>
A sandstorm had shrouded the airport, with the airport terminal smelling of
dusty sand and chairs covered by the yellow grit. Hundreds of rescuers were
still waiting at the airport as of 11 a.m., and it was unknown when the flights
would be resumed, the spokesperson said.
