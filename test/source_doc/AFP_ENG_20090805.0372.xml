China's embassy in Algiers on Wednesday played down violent clashes the previous
day between Chinese and Algerian traders as an isolated incident
unrepresentative of normal relations.
</P>
<P>
"This isolated incident does not reflect the relations between Algerians and
Chinese," an embassy spokeswoman said, adding that China "had confidence in the
Algerian police" to shed light on Tuesday's violence.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Chinese traders clashed with local shopkeepers in the Algerian
capital, residents said Tuesday, after a heated exchange between an Algerian
storekeeper and a Chinese businessman in the city's Bab Ezzouar quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese traders, many armed with knives and iron bars, took on local
residents on Monday afternoon, residents said.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian trader was injured in the suburb, some 15 kilometres (nine miles)
from the city centre.
</P>
<P>
Chinese traders have flooded the North African country, selling goods at cut
throat prices and sparking growing local resentment.
</P>
<P>
The embassy spokeswoman said that China's ambassador to Algeria had visited the
scene of the violence and "asked our nationals to respect the customs and
traditions of the Algerians, to promote the spirit of good neighbourly ties."
