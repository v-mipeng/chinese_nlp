MCDONALD ' S: SIGN ONE OF A KIND LOCALLY PRICE IN DOLLARS, AND IN CALORIES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Order a Big Mac at the McDonald's in Texas Children's Hospital, and
it will set you back 540 calories. A Quarter Pounder will cost you
26 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
Along with prices on the burger joint's menu board in the
hospital, consumers can now see how many calories and grams of fat
and carbohydrates their meal will include.
</P>
<P>
It's the only McDonald's in Texas to have the features, which
the hospital hopes will help consumers make healthier choices.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be good responsible members of the community as
well," said Tabitha Rice, vice president of administration at the
hospital. "It's not about eliminating things from the menu or
dictating what people can or cannot have. It's about providing
information so they can make good decisions."
</P>
<P>
Though the recently installed board is limited to one
restaurant, it's one of the first local signs of support for menu
labeling as the first lady Michelle Obama launches a national
campaign against obesity and Congress considers passing federal
menu transparency laws.
</P>
<P>
Don't look for a trend, though.
</P>
<P>
The chain has no plans to voluntarily replicate the board, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Texas Children's first suggested the revamped menu board in 2006
as the fast-food spot's 20-year lease came up for renewal.
</P>
<P>
The hospital declined to release details about terms of the
lease for the 3,100-square-foot space that has housed the
McDonald's since 1987. But a hospital official said an alternative
vendor was not considered because the burger joint was cooperative.
</P>
<P>
The fast-food chain has locations in 30 hospitals nationwide,
including one in Ben Taub General Hospital since 2001. A spokesman
for the Harris County Hospital District said menu board changes are
being discussed as McDonald's 10-year lease comes up for renewal.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of U.S.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the country, the restaurant has posted calorie
information when required by local lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
About 40 labeling bills have been introduced in states and
counties around the country, according to the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, a Washington, D.C.-based group that has
advocated menu labeling nationwide. They have been implemented in
New York City, Philadelphia, Seattle and Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
Though national support is growing, the industry has argued
posting nutritional information on menu boards is burdensome for
local franchisees. And many chains, like McDonald's, have moved
their support to a proposed federal law, tucked within health care
legislation now stalled in Congress, that would supersede a
patchwork of varying local laws.
</P>
<P>
State Rep. Carol Alvarado , D-Houston, introduced a bill last
year that would have required chain restaurants with 19 or more
locations in Texas to provide nutrition information on menus and
menu boards.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which she plans to reintroduce, never got a hearing
and met resistance from the restaurant industry in light of federal
movement on the issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of menu labeling
</P>
<P>
point to a study by the Stanford Graduate School of Business
released last month that found consumers cut calories about 6
percent when Starbucks, mandated by local laws, began posting
calorie information in its New York City stores.
</P>
<P>
While a number of chains already offer nutritional information
online and in brochures, some also put calorie information on their
menu boards voluntarily. Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell and KFC,
for example, plans to have calorie data on boards at company-owned
restaurants nationwide by 2011. Burger King and Wendy's require all
of their outlets to display posters with nutritional information.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Children's menu board will take time for customers to
get used to, said Dr. Sanjiv Harpavat, a pediatrician who supported
revamping the board as a step toward addressing obesity.
</P>
<P>
"This is information consumers can use if we prepare them for
it," he said, noting that consumers make different choices later
in the day, not just at the counter.
</P>
<P>
Skeptical about labeling
</P>
<P>
Critics say mandatory labeling dismisses personal
responsibility, may hurt consumers if restaurants increasingly rely
on prepackaged foods to ensure accurate calorie counts and doesn't
necessarily lead to better consumer choices.
</P>
<P>
"The findings so far have been mixed," said J. Justin Wilson,
a senior research analyst at the Center for Consumer Freedom, which
is funded in part by the restaurant industry. "On paper it seems
like a good idea but in practice seems relatively ineffective."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on a recent visit to the McDonald's in Texas Children's,
Jose and Veronica Vargas didn't notice the information as he
ordered the 1,090-calorie breakfast with hot cakes and she ordered
a 510-calorie sausage and egg biscuit.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it really matters," said Jose Vargas, who had
been at the hospital four hours while his son was in surgery.
"This is convenient. And if you're just hungry, you don't really
care what it is."
