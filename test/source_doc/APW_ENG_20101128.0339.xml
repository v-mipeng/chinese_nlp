<P>
Sen. John McCain is calling on China to take stronger action to rein in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
McCain says China isn't playing a responsible role in either the Korean peninsula or the world stage.
</P>
<P>
McCain says North Korea's recent actions should lead to discussions about a government change in the North, though not through military action.
</P>
<P>
McCain said that while the threat posed by North Korea is more dangerous today because of its enhanced nuclear capabilities, he believes the North will stop at the verge of war and then ask for economic aid and other assistance, as it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
McCain appeared Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."
