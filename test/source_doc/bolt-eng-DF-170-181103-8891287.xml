<a href="http://money.msn.com/business-news/article.aspx?feed=BLOOM&amp;date=20111028&amp;id=14449745&amp;">Economy in U.S. Surpasses Pre-Recession Level: Bloomberg Business News - MSN Money</a>

The value of goods and services produced in the U.S. surpassed its pre-recession level after 15 quarters, taking three times longer than the average for 10 previous recoveries since World War II.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the period from July through September, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, the fastest pace in a year and up from 1.3 percent in the prior three-month period. After adjusting for inflation, GDP climbed to $13.35 trillion last quarter, topping the $13.33 trillion peak reached in the last three months of 2007.

“The American economy finally has accomplished the recovery and has now entered the expansion,” said Neal Soss, chief economist with Credit Suisse in New York, who was an aide to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. “But the growth is clearly too slow to solve the most significant problems the economy faces: jobs and getting the public budgets under control.”

The only way an improved economy would help Obama's reelection chances is if he gets on his soapbox and brags how he did it singlehandedly.

There are a couple of implications to the data.

1. First the fact that inventories were run down during the quarter, while weighing negatively on GDP in the current quarter, also set up the prospect of firms increasing their orders with manufacturers to restock their inventories which could be a positive for the following quarter(s). Out of all of the ways that GDP could be revised downward, a drop in inventories, as it sets up that prospect of further future orders increasing, might be the best one.

2. On the other hand, we can view the GDP in a negative light in that it may mean that the prospect of more quantitative easing from the Fed is increased.

Simply correcting your numbers from an out of date article, that's all. You don't have to excuse it away.
