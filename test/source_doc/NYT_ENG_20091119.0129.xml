WAS FAKE LAWYER INEFFECTIVE COUNSEL? APPEAL WILL DECIDE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER - Gwen Bergman appealed her murder-for-hire case to the
10th Circuit Court in Denver on Thursday in hopes that a
three-judge panel will overturn the conviction on grounds she had
ineffective counsel.
</P>
<P>
Bergman was represented by Howard Kieffer, an ex-con who
impersonated an attorney during her May 2008 trial in U.S. District
Court in Denver last year.
</P>
<P>
The former Aspen resident was sentenced to nine years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors argue the conviction should stand because
Kieffer was assisted by licensed co-counsel during the trial and no
legal errors occurred.
</P>
<P>
Bergman's appellate attorney argued the case should have never
moved forward to trial because Kieffer alone represented Bergman at
a mental competency hearing and he should never have agreed that
Bergman was ready to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Kieffer was convicted of fraud in U.S. District Court in
Bismarck, N.D. and sentenced to 51 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
He is also indicted on fraud charges related to the Bergman case
in Colorado and is scheduled for a court appearance in Denver on
Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
The 10th Circuit judges are expected to issue a decision in
several weeks.
