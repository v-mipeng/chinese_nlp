Paul Williams earned a bizarre victory Saturday night when Puerto Rico's Kermit Cintron wasn't allowed to continue after tumbling through the ropes and landing on a ringside table early in the fourth round.

The 154-pound (70-kilogram) bout ended with Cintron strapped to a stretcher and wearing a neck brace, though he wanted to get up and keep fighting.

Williams was awarded a technical victory by split decision because he led on two of the three judges' scorecards.

Williams and Cintron exchanged big shots in the early moments of the round before Williams connected with a punch and tried to clinch. When Williams slipped and fell to the canvas, Cintron tripped over Williams' leg and went headfirst through the ropes, hitting a monitor on the table.
