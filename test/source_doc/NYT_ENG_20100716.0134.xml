APPLE OFFERS FREE CASES TO ADDRESS IPHONE ANTENNA ISSUE

<P>
Many expected a mea culpa from Steven P.
Jobs, Apple's chief executive. Instead, he turned the iPhone 4's
antenna problems into a marketing event Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at Apple's headquarters here, Jobs
acknowledged that there were issues with the antenna, which wraps
around the outside of the device.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted the problems, which can result in dropped calls
when the device is held a certain way, affect all smart phones -- a
claim that was challenged by some Apple competitors. And he accused
the media of exaggerating the scope of the issue, saying customers
and reviewers were thrilled with the new phone.
</P>
<P>
"This has been blown so out of proportion that it is
incredible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jobs said that to put the controversy behind it, Apple would
give free bumpers -- cases that wrap around the rim of the phone and
seem to reduce the problem of dropped calls -- to all iPhone 4
buyers who want them.
</P>
<P>
Those who have bought the cases will be reimbursed, and
customers who are still not satisfied can return the phones for a
full refund. The cases will remain free at least until Sept. 30,
when Apple will consider whether it can offer a different solution.
</P>
<P>
Some marketing experts said Jobs had been effective at
deflecting a potentially damaging crisis and predicted that Apple
would suffer little damage from the ruckus over the antenna.
</P>
<P>
"It is inexcusable that this problem was not found out in
advance," said Peter Sealey, a former chief marketing officer of
the Coca-Cola Co., who teaches at the School of Management at
Claremont Graduate University. But he said Jobs "did what he
needed to do. He is the best marketing guy in America, and this is
just a bump in the road."
</P>
<P>
Jobs offered some contrition. He said Apple was not perfect and
apologized to customers affected by the antenna problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are human and we make mistakes sometimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he quickly went on the offensive, saying every smart phone
suffers from similar problems. To bolster his case, he showed
videos of smart phones, including a BlackBerry, an Android-powered
phone and a Windows Mobile device, that dropped signals when they
were held in certain places.
</P>
<P>
When a reporter said he could not replicate the signal drop on
his BlackBerry, Jobs said the problem was only evident in places
where the signal is weak.
</P>
<P>
Most of all, Jobs said time and again that the iPhone 4 was the
best phone Apple had shipped, and that most reviewers believed it
to be the best smart phone on the market. He said he had evidence
to back his claims.
</P>
<P>
First, only 1 in 200 buyers had called Apple to complain about
antenna issues, a historically low number, he said. What's more, he
said that return rates at AT&amp;T, the exclusive carrier of the iPhone
in the United States, were 1.7 percent, or less than a third the
return rates of the iPhone 3GS.
</P>
<P>
Jobs conceded that the iPhone 4 suffered from a slight increase
in dropped calls over the iPhone 3GS but said that the increase was
less than one additional drop for every 100 calls. He would not
provide absolute numbers of dropped calls, but he said that he
believed the increase was because fewer iPhone 4 customers were
using a case, or bumper.
</P>
<P>
"The data supports the fact that the iPhone 4 is the best smart
phone in the world," Jobs said. "And there is no 'Antennagate.'
There is a challenge to the entire industry to improve antenna
performance so that there are no weak spots."
</P>
<P>
Jobs also rejected criticism that Apple had been slow to respond
to complaints about the antenna, saying engineers had been working
around the clock to diagnose the problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is not like Apple has had its head in the sand," he said.
"It has been 22 days."
</P>
<P>
Jobs revealed that Apple had sold more than 3 million of the
black iPhone 4s and said the white model would start shipping at
the end of the month. On July 30, Apple will start selling the
iPhone 4 in 17 additional countries, including Australia, Austria,
Italy, Ireland and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Some Apple rivals took issue with the contention that all smart
phones suffer from antenna problems. Karen Lachtanski, a
spokeswoman for Nokia, said in an e-mail message that antenna
performance can be affected by a tight grip but added: "That's why
Nokia designs our phones to ensure acceptable performance in all
real-life cases, for example when the phone is held in either
hand."
</P>
<P>
Sanjay K. Jha, Motorola's co-chief executive, said in a
statement that his company had avoided putting antennas on the
outside of its phones "because consumers don't like being told how
to hold the phone."
</P>
<P>
Jha said it was "disingenuous to suggest that all phones
perform equally," adding that in the company's tests, Motorola's
new Droid X had performed better than the iPhone 4 when held in the
hand.
</P>
<P>
Other phone makers and carriers contacted did not return calls
for comment.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Consumer Reports, which shone a spotlight on the
iPhone 4 problems by saying Monday that it could not recommend the
device, called Apple's response a "good first step." Paul
Reynolds, the magazine's electronics editor, said it would continue
to withhold its "recommended" rating.
</P>
<P>
"We want to take a little more time to see what else Apple will
come up with," he said.
