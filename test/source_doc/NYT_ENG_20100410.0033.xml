AS FAMILIES GATHER AT DOVER, EFFORTS TO HELP EASE PAIN

DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after 4:20 a.m. on Easter
Sunday, a pair of flag-covered cases with the remains of two
Marines, both killed the previous week in Afghanistan, were carried
out of the belly of a C-17 into the sight of their waiting
families.
</P>
<P>
As two mothers, a widow and a knot of other kin watched from the
tarmac, the bodies of Sgt. Frank J. World, 25, of Buffalo, N.Y.,
and Lance Cpl. Tyler O. Griffin, 19, of Voluntown, Conn., were
loaded into a large van. Marines in white gloves and camouflage
fatigues gave a final salute in the dark chill, then marched in
formation behind the van as it rolled slowly toward the base
mortuary, the largest in the nation.

In the past year, as the remains of 462 service members along
with nearly 2,000 relatives have passed through Dover, the
experience on the flight line has become as common as it is
excruciating. Now, to meet the demand and to accommodate what Dover
officials expect to be increasing casualties from Afghanistan, the
military has embarked on a building surge at this main entry point
for the nation's war dead.
</P>
<P>
In January, Dover opened the Center for the Families of the
Fallen, a $1.6 million, 6,000-square-foot space of soft lighting
and earth-toned furniture where parents, spouses, children,
siblings and other relatives assemble before they are taken to the
flight line. On May 1, there is to be a groundbreaking for a new
$4.5 million hotel for families who need to spend the night. The
same day, ground will also be broken on what Dover officials are
calling a meditation center, a nondenominational space with an
adjacent garden where relatives can pray or be alone.
</P>
<P>
The building boom is under way as the Iraq war is winding down --
some 50,000 American troops are set to withdraw from the country
between now and August -- and as President Barack Obama has set July
2011 for the start of withdrawals from Afghanistan. But most of the
30,000 extra troops Obama ordered to Afghanistan are still due to
arrive this summer, bringing the total American force in that
country to nearly 100,000. Heavy fighting is expected in the months
ahead.

"We would truly like to be out of business," said Col. Robert
H. Edmondson, the commander of the Air Force Mortuary Affairs
Operations Center at Dover. "Clearly, there's a big requirement
right now, and it's a real requirement. So we have to deal with
that."
</P>
<P>
The need to provide for families at the base began a year ago
last week, when a new Pentagon policy reversed an 18-year ban on
photographs of the flag-covered cases and allowed news coverage, if
relatives wished, of the return of the war dead. At the same time,
the military began paying travel and lodging expenses for families
who wanted to be present for the transfers. Before then, expenses
were not paid and families were not encouraged to come.
</P>
<P>
Dover officials had no idea how many families would travel to
witness the 15-minute transfers, but so far about 75 percent have.
Some 55 percent of families have allowed news coverage, these days
often just a single Associated Press photographer. (Steve Ruark, 80
trips to Dover since last May.)
</P>
<P>
Of the 462 service members whose remains have come through Dover
from April 5, 2009, the first day of the new policy, to this past
Thursday, a great majority -- 332 -- were killed in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The nine-suite hotel is to be built by the Fisher House
Foundation, which erects free lodging near military hospitals for
the families of recuperating service members. This Fisher House, as
they are called, is to open in the fall and will be built, like the
others, largely with donations. Obama, who witnessed the return to
Dover of 18 Americans killed in Afghanistan this past October, gave
the foundation $250,000 of his 2009 Nobel Prize money, most of
which will go to the new Dover lodging. For now the military puts
families up in town.
