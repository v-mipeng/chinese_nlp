BEIJING Â— A lion attacked a 10-year-old boy visiting a circus in eastern China, biting off his arm through the bars of its cage, state media said Monday.

The boy was looking at the lion Saturday at Wanfota Park in Mengcheng, a county in Anhui province, when the feline lunged and grabbed the boy with its paws, pulling the child's arm inside the cage, the Xinhua News Agency said.

"Park workers managed to pull the boy away, but his left arm had been torn away by the animal," Xinhua said.

The reason behind the attack was not immediately clear. Doctors at the No. 1 People's Hospital operated on the boy, Xinhua said.

A man who answered the telephone at the hospital's emergency room Monday confirmed that the boy had been treated there and was still recovering. He did not have details and directed queries to the hospital's administrative office, where phones rang unanswered.

Mengcheng police said the space between the cage's iron bars were too large, and failed to properly contain the lion, according to Xinhua.

Police were questioning the park owners and circus organizers.

Last year, a 9-year-old boy was eaten by a crocodile in the southern region of Guangxi. The boy, with three other children, had scaled a fence around a pool in a park where crocodile shows were staged.

They fired at the reptiles with catapults and beat them with wooden sticks until one, riled by the treatment, dragged the boy into the water, where he was eaten by a swarm of crocodiles.

First, I want to say that any place that employs that many clowns is dangerous to begin with and children should be cautioned.

Now I want to ask why the child was close enough to the lion cage that the lion was able to reach him and pull his arm in? Watch your children, parents.

I've never liked going to the circus. One because of the animals being caged and the other...because of clowns.

But it's because of Pennywise that I hate clowns!!! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>

Since last Spring I may make it a yearly tradition to go see the Cole Bros Circus when it's in town. Last year I had a clown...act like a clown and pretended to be afraid of me.

This year I might look for him specifically...and make a video with my little digital camera, while half jokingly trying to scare him.

P.S. Don't mock Pennywise. He was played by the legendary, and quite harmless Tim Curry dont'cha know?

Of course I know. Tim Curry is the only reason I can watch Pennywise. I just don't like clowns. (Want a balloon? <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/> )

Well a baloon might keep you from "floating down!".

And I can further argue that Pennywise isn't scary, IMO. The part where he widens a shower drain and harrases a kd who's trying to shower.

ANY clown who'd try something like that to me would get a face full of shampoo, hit wth the bottle...a bar of soap...and would get a foot in his face. And should pray I didn't drink a lot of coffee and would suddenly have to pee like a horse.

Speaking of "floating down" I was just outside, in the dark, picking up the debris from my weeding/tree trimming yesterday, which just happened to be on top of the water/sewer drain. All I could think of was Pennywise's clawed fingers reaching out of the drain. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>

Clowns make me very nervous. I have a shirt that says "Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me."

There is a whole message board dedicated to Coulrophobia:

And a store:
