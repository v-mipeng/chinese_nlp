afternoon and were seriously hurt.

The officers -- one from Lafayette, the other from Northglenn,
two cities north of Denver -- were thrown from their motorcycles
when one bike clipped the other as a group of more than 30
motorcycle cops were getting onto Colorado-470 in Jefferson County
about 12:30 p.m., according to the Colorado State Patrol.

The officers, who have not been named, received serious but
non-life-threatening injuries, said Trooper Heather Cobbler.

Neither officer was cited, but the collision remains under
investigation, she said. The crash temporarily closed the highway.

Thirty-three officers were taking part in a weeklong
motorcycle-training school for advanced riders at Bandimere
Speedway in Morrison.

"They are all experienced riders," said Jefferson County
Sheriff's spokesman Mark Techmeyer.
