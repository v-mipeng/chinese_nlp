Australia's five-time Olympic gold medallist Ian Thorpe has dropped a defamation
case relating to doping claims published in a French newspaper, his manager said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The champion swimmer brought the case against French newspaper L'Equipe and a
journalist over an article published in March 2007 but had become frustrated by
how long it was taking to resolve, his manager David Flaskas said.
</P>
<P>
"Ian feels he has been vindicated and that it is time for him to move on and let
it go," Flaskas said.
</P>
<P>
"This has dragged on over two years and how long do you keep going?"
</P>
<P>
The French sports newspaper had published details of a urine sample Thorpe
returned in May 2006 that showed abnormal levels of testosterone and leutenising
hormone.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority subsequently found Thorpe had no
case to answer and international swimming body FINA said there was insufficient
evidence he took performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Flaskas said Thorpe had been shocked by the L'Equipe report which was published
after the Australian had retired from the sport he had dominated for most of a
decade.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a shock and it rattled Ian so much, and he was very determined this
was something he did not want any other athlete to be subjected to," he said.
