French Channel ferry workers decided Sunday to prolong their strike for two days
after leaving tens of thousands of travellers stranded over the busy Easter
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Workers at SeaFrance ferries walked off the job on Friday to protest the loss of
a 100-euro (135-dollar) bonus and inadequate staffing for the crossings from
Calais to Dover.

<P>
"The employees met Sunday morning and decided to extend their movement for a
minimum of 48 hours," said union official Didier Cappelle.  "The three ferries
will remain at dock until Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
SeaFrance normally operates between 16 and 19 crossings a day between Calais and
Dover.
</P>
<P>
The company said it had 23,000 reservations for Friday and 12,000 for Saturday,
resulting in losses of 1.25 million euros, said Jean-Claude Dechatte, a
SeaFrance manager.
