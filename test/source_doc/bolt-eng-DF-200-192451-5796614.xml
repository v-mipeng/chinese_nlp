I'll go with 'you're stupid'.

Norway

Spoiler:

<quote>
The number of immigrants in Norway is currently approximately 601,000, which corresponds to 12.2 percent of the total population (2011).

The cities or municipalities with the highest share of immigrants are Oslo (27%) and Drammen (22%). The five largest immigrant groups in Norway are in turn Polish, Swedish, Pakistanis, Iraqi and Somali.

The unemployment rate for foreign-born Norwegians is 9.2 percent, compared to a figure of 2.1 percent for the general population.

Since 1970, the immigrant population from Nordic countries and Western Europe has increased modestly from around 50,000 to around 120,000. In the same time frame however, the immigrant population from outside these regions, has increased dramatically from barely anything to more than 420,000 (137,572 from Eastern Europe, and 284,246 from Asia, Africa and South America). During the course of the first four-year term of the ruling Red-Green Coalition government (2005â€“2009), the immigrant population of Norway increased by 41 percent, or 143,300 persons.

Sweden

Spoiler:

<quote>
As of 2010 however, 1.33 million people or 14.3% of the inhabitants in Sweden were foreign-born. Of these, 859,000 (9.2%) were born outside the European Union and. Sweden has been transformed from a nation of emigration ending after World War I to a nation of immigration from World War II onwards. In 2009, immigration reached its highest level since records began with 102,280 people migrating to Sweden while the total population grew by 84,335.

A government study in 2006 estimated that 39% of the Muslim population harbour strong and consistent antisemitic views.

Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmo to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment estimating that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year.

Attacks on Jews in Malmo totaled 79 in 2009, about twice as many as the previous year, according to police statistics.

Immigrants are overrepresented in Sweden's crime statistics.

There are around 205 countries worldwide, depending on which ones you recognise; there are 187 countries ranked on the UN HDI, with a further 18 countries recognised but not ranked, giving a total of 205. The UK is 28th on the list, so it's still better than 87% of other countries, by that measure.

That's silly logic, in effect comparing Britain with a war torn poverty ridden country.

Britain has the 5/6th largest economy thus finishing 28th on a QoL index has to be disappointing.

I'm quite impressed with the Dutch government, you can't fault it for doing what is best in the interest of their entire country. Also I'm very impressed that for a country that is known to be tolerant it is open to coming clean with regard to discussing issues that couldn't be dreamt of in Britain.

However for me, I will take the Swiss government especially the Federal and the cantonal authority of Zurich. High levels of transparency, efficiency is top notch, policies tend to benefit everyone rather than just the bankers considering how important the banking industry is to this country. Bureaucracy? Ever heard of Swiss bureaucracy? Bet you haven't.... there is a reason for that because when we ask for any services from the government we are told upfront how it works, when it can happen and they keep to their word. The good thing about the Swiss government and politicians as a whole? Unlike British ones, they don't lie and they never make promises that can't be kept. I generally have very little faith and trust in any British politicians or politicians as a whole, but that somewhat changed after I started living in Switzerland.

The stats won't lie, Switzerland has the most competitive economy in the world, quality of life is among the highest in all of Europe.

The attitude of government and politics are very different, I've yet to find a tax that is 'political' here, unlike in Britain where there is a 50p tax rate that is mostly a political and class war tax, then there is talk of a 'mansion tax' all of which stink of class warfare rather than anything else.

The thing that always amazes me about the Swiss government? They can do so much, so well without running big huge deficits and no need for big tax bills either.

Yes we have a higher ratio of debt, but given how powerful our economy is the uk's potential to pay back such debts far exceeds that of moldova.

Even if the uk was a sinking ship of a country (which it's not, infact far from it), at least we had a ship to sink.

The very fact that you are trying to criticise my education merely because I mistakenly left out an f in the word 'off' just shows how desperate you are.

Secondly I have not said Glasgow is by any means a perfect city, but it is certainly no worse than London and most other cities in the UK. It may have had a troubled past but today Glasgow " <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow">has the third highest GDP Per capita of any city in the UK (after London and Edinburgh).</a> ". Infact even if Glasgow was the worst **** hole in the UK (which it isn't) then I'd hate to see what the worst place in Moldova is like.

You can keep trying to find a clause in your failed logic, however like I said, you should look at the state of your own affairs before pointing the finger at others.

less people means less money needed for the upkeep of a welfare state. plus, people are living longer and and working longer.

all it needs is transition into its ageing society and it will be fine. the western model is to keep on increasing the base but it will have to do this every generation so eventually britain will be a country of few billion people..not a sane way to deal with an ageing population.

Norway

...

These are all facts.

</quote>

Yes, they are facts of the immigrant demographics of the country, not the immigration policy. AFAIK Norway's immigration policy is quite strict, although it wasn't in the 70's, which lead to mass immigration. I think the "temporary immigration stop" of 1975 is still in effect, with exceptions for highly educated people, some other groups, and obviously the EEC. And as other UN countries Norway's obliged to take refugees/a certain amount of political asylum seekers. (I'm not really big on politics to be honest, but if you know Norwegian/think Google Translate does a good job you can read more about it all <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/krd/dok/nouer/2004/nou-2004-20/4.html?id=387352">here</a> - an actual source. Or if Wikipedia suits your needs, try translate on <a href="http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsk_innvandringspolitikk">this</a> page.)

Terrible English. Are you the product of such an amazing nation? You can't even spell 'off'. I'm aware of what the HDI is, but when you look at the measures it has a Western bias. Glasgow is far from the perfect city (crime, drink, deprivation, pollution), yet you ignore this because the UK, as a whole, is seen as a good place to live. Delusion.

It was some offensive four-letter word - unfortunately, that leaves much to the imagination. Anyway, you haven't revealed any truth.

The UK has issues that it needs to resolve - debt, poverty, a poorly performing education system, etc. These issues plague most developed countries.

But Moldova suffers political instability, cultural conflict, a fledgling economy, corruption and bribery on an overwhelming scale - some even assert that Moldova was doomed from the beginning, as a product of foreign influences, which is something that can be said for many third world countries.

I'm not sure what leg you have to stand on in asserting that Moldova is in a stronger position than the UK.

I know what the word was, but where is the use in repeating it? If you can't express yourself without vulgar and demeaning language then you're no more educated than a monkey who throws excrement.

I didn't state that Moldova is in a stronger position that the UK, so I don't know where that has come from. What I did state, however, was that the UK has an exorbitant level of debt. 400% of the GDP is not something that can be ignored, is it? I was then met with the statistic that Moldova is 111th in the HDI. If I'm not mistaken, the HDI is an overview of a country which can mask issues within particular cities e.g. Glasgow, London, New York, etc.

Even people with quite a refined vocabulary can enjoy foul language - just ask Stephen Fry!

The UK does have exorbitant debt, at the moment - in the wake of a recession. The UK had shocking debt in the aftermath of the Second World War, but managed to reduce it with the re-organisation and recovery of the national and international economy - a feat which I'm confident that we'll be able to repeat.

Income inequality is a common, but poignant issue, in the United Kingdom - something which has also fluctuated with the times - it rose quite substantially under Thatcher, but has been falling since (although it probably increased with the recession). Britain's issues are persistent, almost cyclical, but they are also surmountable. I'm just not sure what is the point of showing Moldova's low national debt unless you're trying to make a point - it's obvious that Moldova is a bloody mess.

Panama; they've got a strong democratic constitution that has been proven to work, major decisions such as expanding the canal all go through a public referendum, they've got one of the best world leaders running the show at the moment.

Niue; their cabinet is absurdly large but otherwise they seem to have an effective political system, working without political parties for example, and its a nice place to visit compared to some other Pacific Islands.

Essentially, the Nordic countries. They consistently rank top in a range of measures from respected international organisations. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway. Finland, Norway and Sweden all ranked last, second last and third last respectively in The fund for peace ( US think tank) failed states index, I.e they are the most stable. Denmark was not far behind them and Iceland only a little further up.

Yes, I agree that the Prof Nutt issue was wrong. I never said we were perfect. I never even said that we were the best. I just said that we were in the top 10%, because we have free and fair elections, the NHS, good free education up to age 18, a welfare state to act as a safety net for those who fall on hard times, a police force that is often seen as the envy of the world (given the v. low levels of corruption and police brutality etc.), clean safe drinking water, high incomes etc. All of these things have been achieved, in one way or another, through the British political system.

There are always exceptions to the above examples, but 99% of the time they are true.
