<P>
Lenovo, one of the world's leading personal computer manufacturers, said here on
Friday that it saw a significant potential in the personal computer (PC) market
in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is one of Lenovo's targeted emerging markets, where more PC penetration
could be expected, said Qi Yong, transactional business manager of Lenovo
(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lenovo believes that Malaysia is one of the fast- growing countries
in the world and Lenovo's business partners in the country are also growing
fast.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Lenovo introduced a new strategy to target at what it regards
as emerging markets, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
Lenovo (Malaysia) attached great importance to its local distributors, Qi said,
adding that the number of Lenovo's distributors has increased to four.
</P>
<P>
Qi also said that Lenovo would strive to introduce its successful experience in
PC business in China into Malaysia and develop more its channels towards its
targeted end users, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the
country.
</P>
<P>
SMEs are the important market in Malaysia as 99.2 percent of the enterprises are
SMEs in the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Qi also said that the Malaysian PC market is quite different from that
in China, especially the sales seasons.
</P>
<P>
Lenovo's business has grown signficantly in Malaysia since its presence in 2005.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Lenovo opened two new design concept shops at Low Yat Plaza,
the key IT mall in Malaysia. It was the first time that Lenovo's global new
design concept shops were established in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
So far, Lenovo has had four concept shops in Malaysia and other ten Lenovo
stalls at large chain stores in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Lenovo (Malaysia) said that it would increase its investments in retailing and
channels and introduce high quality and innovative products in Malaysia to
ensure its growth.
