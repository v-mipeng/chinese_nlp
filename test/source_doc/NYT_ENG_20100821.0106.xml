FISHER RENEWING SAMFORD CONNECTION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TALLAHASSEE  For Jimbo Fisher, Florida State's season-opening
football game against Samford on Sept. 4 represents nothing short
of a karmic confluence of events.
</P>
<P>
His first collegiate football game as a player came against the
school in 1984. His last game as a player came for it in 1987. His
first game as a coach came for Samford in 1988, and now his first
game as a head coach after taking over for the legendary Bobby
Bowden comes against the Division I-AA Samford Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
Fisher admitted the surreal linkage between him and one small
school in Birmingham, Ala., hadn't registered with him until his
mother, Gloria, pointed it out.
</P>
<P>
But he's amazed by the quirkiness, as are others.
</P>
<P>
"He just can't get away from Samford, can he?" said Scotty
King, a former Samford teammate.
</P>
<P>
Changing places
</P>
<P>
Fisher, 44, would never have competed against Samford as a
player had he maintained his initial course. He began his college
career at Clemson, where he was set to play second base for the
Tigers' baseball team.
</P>
<P>
But he didn't remain in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Or in baseball.
</P>
<P>
"I played fall ball and left," said Fisher, who gave up
baseball as a freshman but remains a huge fan; he fervently
supports Mike Martin at FSU and traveled to Omaha this year for the
College World Series. "Where I came from, the hills of West
Virginia, to go there, Lord oh mighty. You talk about culture
shock."
</P>
<P>
So he transferred to Salem (W.Va.) College, which was just a
short drive west on state highway 50 from his hometown of
Clarksburg, and played quarterback for the NAIA program led by an
up-and-coming young coach, Terry Bowden.
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9, strong-armed, competitive Fisher, recruited by
Bowden out of high school, perfectly fit Bowden's pro-style offense
and led Salem to an 8-3 record in 1984. That after it was 3-7 the
year before.
</P>
<P>
That breakout season began Sept.??1 in Birmingham against
Samford, then a Division III program with a rich tradition  Bobby
Bowden was a star quarterback there in the early 1950s when it was
called Howard College and later was his alma mater's coach  that
was restarting football after a decade of dormancy.
</P>
<P>
It was a mismatch on paper.
</P>
<P>
Salem featured several big-time prospects looking for a new
start such as one-time FSU tight end Orson Mobley as well as
Fisher, while Samford didn't have scholarship players.
</P>
<P>
It was a mismatch on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
Salem 82, Samford 9.
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember a whole lot about the game," said Mobley,
who often played pickup basketball with Fisher in their days at
Salem and went on to a stellar NFL career in Denver. "I know Jimbo
had a big day. He was short on stature and wasn't the fastest guy,
but he was competitive and was just a born leader. "
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I remember it," said King, a freshman quarterback for
Samford in 1984. "I remember watching Jimbo leading them up and
down the field. We were embarrassed to say the least, but we had to
start somewhere  and it was kind of funny the way it came full
circle with Coach (Terry) Bowden and Jimbo coming to Samford, and
we ended up beating people as badly as they beat us."
</P>
<P>
Following Bowden I
</P>
<P>
Terry Bowden was hired by Samford in 1987, and though he had
been away from Salem for a year to work for Gerry Faust at Akron,
some of his former players from the West Virginia school followed
him south.
</P>
<P>
Including his old quarterback.
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to leave home; I was more mature," Fisher said.
"They went bananas when I left. I was an All-American, the
conference player of the year, but I knew if I wanted to have a
career after ball coaching, I had to get back with Terry."
</P>
<P>
His new teammates understood what kind of player was coming
their way.
</P>
<P>
"There was a presence there," said Gerald Neaves, then a
senior receiver who was part of the 1984 team that lost so badly to
Salem. "We just had a confidence in him."
</P>
<P>
That feeling permeated both sides of the ball. From Day 1. Even
from a player who, after three years of playing quarterback, lost
his starting job  Scotty King.
</P>
<P>
"Over that summer, we just hit it off," said King, who went to
Bowden to suggest he move to cornerback, where he did quite well.
"He's a great guy. He was definitely the right person to have at
quarterback, and I was definitely willing to make the move to help
the team."
</P>
<P>
" We had a (great) camaraderie," said Fisher, who remains
close with King. "All they wanted to do was win. Terry did a good
job of managing that. It was just a unique year."
</P>
<P>
With an unforgettable finish Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
Destiny
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs, 8-1 and looking to match the program's record for
wins, trailed host Wingate (N.C.) College 38-27 late in the third
quarter that fall day. But Fisher punctuated his senior season in
spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
He directed four touchdown drives in the fourth quarter for a
54-46 win. The quarter's fireworks included two touchdown passes, a
75-yarder to John Harper and a 6-yarder to Steve Miles, to give
Fisher 34 on the year, a Division III record.
</P>
<P>
"We were all about the team and winning, but we all felt that
was a major accomplishment," said Neaves, who had two catches for
33 yards to make him the school's career leader at the time with
1,817 receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
Fisher was 22-of-40 for 451 yards and four touchdowns (with no
interceptions) and one rushing touchdown. That pushed his season
totals to 2,394 passing yards, 237 rushing yards and 40 touchdowns.
He was named the Division III player of the year.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us had aspirations of doing something sports-related
after we got out of school," said Neaves, now a longtime high
school coach in the Birmingham area. "Jimbo went on to play in the
arena league for a while, but I knew he was heading toward a
coaching career. It was just his destiny."
</P>
<P>
Following Bowden II
</P>
<P>
Fisher began to fulfill that destiny, predictably enough, at
Samford in 1988 by working with the quarterbacks for his old coach.
But he really began earlier than that.
</P>
<P>
"Jimbo always spent a lot of extra time in the film room with
Coach Bowden," King said. "Even as a player, he lived and
breathed football."
</P>
<P>
The son of a coal miner and school teacher (his mother is
entering her 51st year teaching high school chemistry), Fisher had
a tireless, blue-collar work ethic imprinted on him from the womb.
</P>
<P>
He carried that into his new profession and worked to absorb as
much as he could from Terry and his famous father, Bobby, who
literally opened his home to the youngster as if he were part of
the extended family. At bowl games, Fisher was allowed to don a
headset so he could listen in to the playcalling. But Papa Bowden
also became a mentor off the field.
</P>
<P>
"My core values are his core values  God, family, ball. In that
order," Fisher said. "He was a hero of mine. He was a guy you
looked up to and said, 'One day, I want to be where he's at.'?"
</P>
<P>
After working his way through the ranks, Fisher found himself
precisely where his hero was  in Tallahassee. Hired in 2007 as the
offensive coordinator, he became the head coach in waiting after
one season. Though he wasn't contractually required to be offered
the top job until January 2011 and Bowden had planned and deeply
desired to coach one final year in 2010, outgoing president T.K.
Wetherell decided not to renew Bowden's contract after last season.
</P>
<P>
That paved the way for a new era with an intriguing start, an
opponent specifically picked in 2008 with Bowden in mind; an
opponent that also was an ideal match for his successor as karma
would have it.
</P>
<P>
"The first game I'll coach as head coach, at a time it wasn't
supposed to happen, is against them," Fisher said, shaking his
head in disbelief, of yet another rendezvous with Samford as a
partner. "It's really ironic."
