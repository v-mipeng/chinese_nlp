The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) called for Macau Monday to consider
establishing a liaison office in Taiwan to help bolster bilateral relations and
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the MAC -- Taiwan's top China policy coordinating body --
congratulated Fernando Chui Sai On on his election as the new chief executive of
the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) and called on him to make
bilateral ties closer than before.
</P>
<P>
Noting  that both Taiwan  and Macau sit in geographically significant positions
as gateways, the MAC said closer and more stable ties between Taiwan and Macau
would be conducive to the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The MAC statement expressed hope that Chui, who will replace Edmund Ho as the
third head of the Macau SAR -- a former Portuguese overseas province -- will
strengthen Macau's ties with Taiwan based on the solid foundation that was laid
by Ho and his administrative team over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Chui, who resigned May 12 as secretary for social affairs and culture of the
Macau government to run as the sole candidate in the election for Macau's chief
executive post, was elected Sunday the chief executive after getting 282 votes,
or 94 percent of the votes, from Macau's 300-member Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
He is set to become the new chief executive Dec. 20 for a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Born in Macau in 1957, Chui graduated from the California State University at
Sacramento in community health and later obtained a Masters degree in health
administration and a Ph.d in Public Health from the University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed secretary for social affairs and culture of the Macau
government in 1999 and in 2004 was re-appointed for a second term.
