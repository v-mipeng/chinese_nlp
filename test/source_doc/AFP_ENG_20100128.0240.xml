<P>
An oil painting once erroneously believed to have been by Leonardo da Vinci sold
for a much better than expected 1.5 million dollars at auction Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"La Belle Ferronniere" -- real painter unknown -- went under the hammer at
Sotheby's in New York for 1.538 million dollars, far above pre-auction estimates
of 300,000-500,000 dollars, although nowhere near the going price for a true da
Vinci.
</P>
<P>
The painting was listed as by "a follower" of the Italian genius.
</P>
<P>
The oil painting, depicting a richly dressed woman looking out over her left
side, was wrongly identified in 1929, provoking a scandalous art world court
case.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 a da Vinci specialist ruled that the painting was executed in the mid-
17th century -- more than a century after da Vinci died.
