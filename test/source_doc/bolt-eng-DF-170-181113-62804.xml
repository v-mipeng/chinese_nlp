CRA Not to Blame for Housing Debacle

The idea that the CRA was a big contributor to the housing debacle keeps popping up. Thus, I'm creating a new thread to refute this assertion.

The San Francisco Fed says that the CRA was not a primary contributor to the housing bubble.

<quote>
A pair of economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco added another piece of evidence to the case that the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act wasnt the cause, or even a major contributor, to the subprime mortgage debacle.

In a paper focused on California that was presented at a Fed conference on housing and mortgages in Washington, D.C., Elizabeth Laderman and Carolina Reid say the data should help to quell if not fully lay to rest the arguments that the CRA caused the current subprime lending boom by requiring banks to lend irresponsibly in low and moderate-income lenders. Fed governor Randall Kroszner made a similar case earlier this week.

Among the specific findings in Lending in Low- and Moderate-Income Neighborhoods in California: The Performance of CRA Lending During the Subprime Meltdown:
# Overall, lending to low and moderate income communities comprised only a small share of toal lending by CRA lenders, even during the height of the California subprime lending boom.
# Loans originated by lenders regulated under CRA in general were significantly less likely to be in foreclosure than those originated by independent mortgage companies that werent covered by CRA.
# Loans made by CRA lenders within their geographic assessment areas covered by the law were half as likely to go into foreclosure as those made by the independent mortgage companies.
# 28% of loans made by CRA lenders in low income areas within their geographic assessment areas were fixed-rate loans, compared with 18.2% of loans made by independent mortgage companies in low income areas.
# 12% of the loans made by CRA lenders in these areas were high-priced loans, a technical definition of subprime, compared with 29% of the loans made by those lenders outside their assessment areas and 52.4% of loans made by independent mortgage companies in low-income areas.

Federal Reserve governor, Randall Kroszner, says the CRA had little effect on home prices.

<quote>
The striking result, Kroszner said: Only 6% of all the higher-priced loans were extended by CRA-covered lenders to lower-income borrowers or neighborhoods in their CRA assessment areas, the local geographies that are the primary focus for CRA evaluation purposes.

This result undermines the assertion by critics of the potential for a substantial role for the CRA in the subprime crisis. In other words, the very small share of all higher-priced loan originations that can reasonably be attributed to the CRA makes it hard to imagine how this law could have contributed in any meaningful way to the current subprime crisis. Banks can also meet CRA obligations by buying loans from mortgage brokers, he noted. But less than 2% of the higher-priced loans (those would help banks meet CRA requirements) sold by independent mortgage companies were purchased by CRA-covered institutions.

Another good post

<quote>
Let's clarify the causes of current circumstances. Ask yourself the following questions about the impact of the Community Reinvestment Act and/or the role of Fannie &amp; Freddie:

 Did the 1977 legislation, or any other legislation since, require banks to not verify income or payment history of mortgage applicants?

 50% of subprime loans were made by mortgage service companies not subject comprehensive federal supervision; another 30% were made by banks or thrifts which are not subject to routine supervision or examinations. How was this caused by either CRA or GSEs ?

 What about "No Money Down" Mortgages (0% down payments) ? Were they required by the CRA? Fannie? Freddie?

 Explain the shift in Loan to value from 80% to 120%: What was it in the Act that changed this traditional lending requirement?

 Did any Federal legislation require real estate agents and mortgage writers to use the same corrupt appraisers again and again? How did they manage to always come in at exactly the purchase price, no matter what?

 Did the CRA require banks to develop automated underwriting (AU) systems that emphasized speed rather than accuracy in order to process the greatest number of mortgage apps as quickly as possible?

 How exactly did legislation force Moody's, S&amp;Ps and Fitch to rate junk paper as Triple AAA?

 What about piggy back loans? Were banks required by Congress to lend the first mortgage and do a HELOC for the down payment -- at the same time?

 Internal bank memos showed employees how to cheat the system to get poor mortgages prospects approved that shouldn't have been: Titled How to Get an "Iffy" loan approved at JPM Chase. (Was circulating that memo also a FNM/FRE/CRA requirement?)

 The four biggest problem areas for housing (by price decreases) are: Phoenix, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; Miami, Florida, and San Diego, California. Explain exactly how these affluent, non-minority regions were impacted by the Community Reinvesment Act ?

 Did the GSEs require banks to not check credit scores? Assets? Income?

 What was it about the CRA or GSEs that mandated fund managers load up on an investment product that was hard to value, thinly traded, and poorly understood

 What was it in the Act that forced banks to make "interest only" loans? Were "Neg Am loans" also part of the legislative requirements also?

 Consider this February 2003 speech by Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozlilo at the American Bankers National Real Estate Conference. He advocated zero down payment mortgages -- was that a CRA requirement too, or just a grab for more market share, and bad banking?

The answer to all of the above questions is no, none, and nothing at all.

More on the genesis of the CRA

<quote>
Let’s put some context around what the CRA is and isn’t.

In the 1960s and 70s, banks would redline neighborhoods. They would literally put a map on a wall, and with a red magic marker, draw a redline enveloping certain neighborhoods. If you lived within the redlined areas, regardless of your income, credit score, assets, debt servicing ability, if you were in the redlined area you could not qualify for a mortgage.

Although Redlining was made illegal by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the practice still surreptitiously continued. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was the next attempt to stop redlining. There were two main aspects of the CRA: First, it required banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities. Credit Score, Loan-to-value, percentage of monthly take home, etc. had to be the same across different areas.

Second, the Community Reinvestment Act required banks to make good faith attempts to loan the money back to its own depositors. If you open up a branch in Harlem, you cannot suck up all the local business and residents’ cash, and then turn around and only lend it out to Tribeca condo buyers. You must make a fair attempt to loan the money locally. Banks have no obligation to open branches in Harlem, but if they did, they are required to at least try to lend the locals back their own money.

Note that there are no quotas, minimums or mandates. This is a very soft rating system.

Good thread, Toro, though since you aren't Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh you have no credibility with people that are bound and determined to scapegoat low income blacks.

It's basic common sense to realize that the sum total of property mortgages owned by lower-income people is no where valuable enough to have more than the tiniest blip on the overall economy.

The people in charge WERE responisble for this mess but the CRA wasn't why or how this mess happened.

The fact that Fannie and Freddie would accept NINA loans is the root cause of the mortgage meltdown.

The CRA existed for decades without causing a meltdown.

But once Fannie said it was OKAY to sell a mortgage to people who had no income and no assets, AND THE BANKS WENT ALONG WITH THAT TO MAKE A LOT OF SALES, then this crises took root in our fiancial system.

I do not understand why some of you have problems understanding this.

It's fairly easy to understand.

If the CRA was the problem then all the bad mortgages would be found in the GHETTOS of America.

Are they?

Now, actually very few of them are in those bad neighborhoods.

Most of them are in CALIFORNIA and FLORDIA AND NEVADA's supposedly middle class neighborhoods.

The CRA had nothing whatever to do with those houses being built or sold to people with NINA loans.

There wasn't any such requirement. The requirement was that minority communities not be red-lined and that qualified borrowers in minority communities be given appropriate consideration.

The banks tossed away their OWN risk assessment requirements because property values kept going up and up and up and they made money on every re-fi. Then when housing values started to drop, the people who borrowed ended up owing more than the current value of their house, so weren't eligible any longer. They ended up with ARM's (which their mortgage peoplse swore to them they wouldn't be subject to b/c they would re-fi) which they couldn't afford.

The simultaneous change in the bankruptcy law which prohibited most people from getting rid of their commercial debt and protecting their secured debt (their home) also helped to contribute to the current crisis.

If the banks re-negotiated the loan amounts to their intitial values, most people would be able to make their payments, anyway. Hence the talk about courts re-structuring the debt (same as they do in bankruptcy).

Given that this challenge to produce evidence to support the contention that the CRA is the root cause of mortgage crises has been made many times already, and it has been completely ignored (except to announce again and again that it is true, of course) I think you're going to be disappointed.

Tenacious things facts.

We can deny them till the cows come home, and we can find supporters who will deny them with us, but still these facts refuse to buckle under to popular opinion.

In a commentary for CNN, Congressman Ron Paul, who serves on the United States House Committee on Financial Services, charged the CRA with "forcing banks to lend to people who normally would be rejected as bad credit risks."[58] In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Austrian school economist Russell Roberts wrote that the CRA subsidized low-income housing by pressuring banks to serve poor borrowers and poor regions of the country.[59] Jeffrey A. Miron, a senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University, in an opinion piece for CNN, calls for getting rid of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as policies like the Community Reinvestment Act that pressure banks into subprime lending.[60]

<quote>
During a 2008 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the financial crisis, including in relation to the Community Reinvestment Act, asked if the CRA provided the fuel for increasing subprime loans, former Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines said it might have been a catalyst encouraging bad behavior, but it was difficult to know. Raines also cited information that only a small percentage of risky loans originated as a result of the CRA. Bob McTeer, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank from 1991 to 2004, said There was a lot of pressure from Congress and generally everywhere to make homeownership affordable for poor and low-income people. Some mortgages were made that would not have ordinarily been made. He also said When a bank made a decision to purchase mortgaged-backed securities, they would somehow determine if some of them were in zip codes covered by the CRA, and therefore they could get CRA credit.[72][73]

Wish I could say that I am convinced, but the weight of experience inveighs against. If figures could not be made to lie, we wouldn't need a judicial system.

It feels counter intuitive to believe that the multiple items re: CRA, videos of Frank, Dodd, Cuomo, the redistributary policies of Dems, would have no involvement in current financial crisis.

Since well over 90% of homes are up to date on mortgage payments, how many of the remaining are due to policy factors?

As far as current evidence, let's remember that in 1920 the NYTimes editorial stated that rockets could never fly, and, the best evidence against your premise: Ravi agrees with you.

Gramm, Leach, Bliley act of 1999 caused the flood gates to open.

By allowing the lending industry to purchase too many aspects of the market.

Glass Steagal protected us from this for years until the whittling away of that law was complete after the siging of the GLBact 1999 by Clinton.

Phil Gramm fought for years to pass this idea.

Clinton should not have signed it.

Bush and team should have created a new law and barriers to this mess.

The sub prime loans were not a problem until they became a profit machine by the passing of GLB act 1999.

These are facts folks and history has repeted its self and history will in time get rid of all these other stupid and false ideas created for political purposes.

Miron, a senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University, in an opinion piece for CNN, calls for getting rid of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as policies like the Community Reinvestment Act that pressure banks into subprime lending.[60]

During a 2008 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the financial crisis, including in relation to the Community Reinvestment Act, asked if the CRA provided the fuel for increasing subprime loans, former Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines said it might have been a catalyst encouraging bad behavior, but it was difficult to know. Raines also cited information that only a small percentage of risky loans originated as a result of the CRA. Bob McTeer, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank from 1991 to 2004, said There was a lot of pressure from Congress and generally everywhere to make homeownership affordable for poor and low-income people. Some mortgages were made that would not have ordinarily been made. He also said When a bank made a decision to purchase mortgaged-backed securities, they would somehow determine if some of them were in zip codes covered by the CRA, and therefore they could get CRA credit.[72][73]

Insults are not necessary. Yes, I am a Scientist. You obviously did not read the story. Next time you want to fling an insult, at least be able to back it up.

Here's some pertinent information:

<quote>
Beginning in 1992, Congress pushed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase their purchases of mortgages going to low and moderate income borrowers. For 1996, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) gave Fannie and Freddie an explicit target -- 42% of their mortgage financing had to go to borrowers with income below the median in their area. The target increased to 50% in 2000 and 52% in 2005.

For 1996, HUD required that 12% of all mortgage purchases by Fannie and Freddie be "special affordable" loans, typically to borrowers with income less than 60% of their area's median income. That number was increased to 20% in 2000 and 22% in 2005. The 2008 goal was to be 28%. Between 2000 and 2005, Fannie and Freddie met those goals every year, funding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans, many of them subprime and adjustable-rate loans, and made to borrowers who bought houses with less than 10% down.

Fannie and Freddie also purchased hundreds of billions of subprime securities for their own portfolios to make money and to help satisfy HUD affordable housing goals. Fannie and Freddie were important contributors to the demand for subprime securities.

etc.

The sub prime loans were not profitable until the consolidation of the securites industry was allowed to happen.

They made no one money until Gramm, Leach, Bliely was passed in 1999.

It is so clear that CRA was no threat until this that its insane to blame any other aspect of the situation.

The idea that the CRA was a big contributor to the housing debacle keeps popping up. Thus, I'm creating a new thread to refute this assertion.

The San Francisco Fed says that the CRA was not a primary contributor to the housing bubble.

<quote>
A pair of economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco added another piece of evidence to the case that the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act wasnt the cause, or even a major contributor, to the subprime mortgage debacle.

In a paper focused on California that was presented at a Fed conference on housing and mortgages in Washington, D.C., Elizabeth Laderman and Carolina Reid say the data should help to quell if not fully lay to rest the arguments that the CRA caused the current subprime lending boom by requiring banks to lend irresponsibly in low and moderate-income lenders. Fed governor Randall Kroszner made a similar case earlier this week.

Among the specific findings in Lending in Low- and Moderate-Income Neighborhoods in California: The Performance of CRA Lending During the Subprime Meltdown:
# Overall, lending to low and moderate income communities comprised only a small share of toal lending by CRA lenders, even during the height of the California subprime lending boom.
# Loans originated by lenders regulated under CRA in general were significantly less likely to be in foreclosure than those originated by independent mortgage companies that werent covered by CRA.
# Loans made by CRA lenders within their geographic assessment areas covered by the law were half as likely to go into foreclosure as those made by the independent mortgage companies.
# 28% of loans made by CRA lenders in low income areas within their geographic assessment areas were fixed-rate loans, compared with 18.2% of loans made by independent mortgage companies in low income areas.
# 12% of the loans made by CRA lenders in these areas were high-priced loans, a technical definition of subprime, compared with 29% of the loans made by those lenders outside their assessment areas and 52.4% of loans made by independent mortgage companies in low-income areas.
</quote>
<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/12/04/dont-blame-cra-the-sequel/">Real Time Economics : Don't Blame CRA (The Sequel)</a>

Federal Reserve governor, Randall Kroszner, says the CRA had little effect on home prices.

<quote>
The striking result, Kroszner said: Only 6% of all the higher-priced loans were extended by CRA-covered lenders to lower-income borrowers or neighborhoods in their CRA assessment areas, the local geographies that are the primary focus for CRA evaluation purposes.

This result undermines the assertion by critics of the potential for a substantial role for the CRA in the subprime crisis. In other words, the very small share of all higher-priced loan originations that can reasonably be attributed to the CRA makes it hard to imagine how this law could have contributed in any meaningful way to the current subprime crisis. Banks can also meet CRA obligations by buying loans from mortgage brokers, he noted. But less than 2% of the higher-priced loans (those would help banks meet CRA requirements) sold by independent mortgage companies were purchased by CRA-covered institutions.

I asked a question: post the verbiage of a law that required banks to lend money to people that couldn't pay it back.

You responded with people's opinions, none of your responses listed a law.

btw, a few of my neighbors probably make less than the neighborhood's median income but that doesn't mean they can't pay back a loan.

I'll ask again, where is the verbiage of a law that required banks to lend money to people that couldn't pay it back?

Of course, everyone has a spectrum through which they view the world, me included. We are all biased to some extent. That is why we should rely on empirical data and a general consensus of experts to understand an issue, not politically biased media and commentators, especially of those who have a vested interest in ensuring their ideology is not discredited, whether that is conservative or liberal or whatever.

The interesting links indicate multiple cause, and I tend to agree. I don't agree that the CRA is without a major partof the blame.

CRA was a force behind the following:
WASHINGTON  Top executives at mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ignored warnings that they were taking on too many risky loans years before the housing market plunged, according to documents released Tuesday by a House committee.

E-mails and other internal documents released by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee show that former Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd and former Freddie Mac CEO Richard Syron disregarded recommendations that they stay away from riskier types of loans.

"Their irresponsible decisions are now costing the taxpayers billions of dollars," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, which reviewed nearly 400,000 internal documents from Fannie and Freddie.

And this from the NYTimes:
In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.

And check this out:

Under the CRA, banks must convince a set of bureaucracies that they are not engaging in discrimination, a charge that the act encourages any CRA-recognized community group to bring forward.

There are two issues here. First is Fannie and Freddie. Nobody is saying that Fannie and Freddie were not a systemic risk to the financial system. Clearly, they were. But the criticism is in the wrong direction. The criticism is not that Fannie and Freddie made bad loans. The issue is that Fannie and Freddie weren't capitalized well enough. The amount of capital the GSEs had on their balance sheets to support all their loans was 2%. That's nuts. If their portfolio falls 2%, they are effectively insolvent. If you are looking for a Democratic scapegoat, this is as good as any since the Democrats were the primary enabler of the GSE. However, it should be noted that when the GOP controlled every facet of government from 2002 to 2006 - when all this bad debt was being built up on their balance sheets - they chose to turn their heads and do nothing. It should also be noted that it wasn't just Freddie and Fannie that were not well capitalized enough. It was also Lehman, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Wachovia, IndyMac, AIG, and many other financial institutions, all of whom were not government entities! In this sense, the GSEs were behaving like their private market competitors.

It should also be noted in the links provided that the criticism was that "the government forced lending through the GSEs via the CRA." The articles leave the impression that the CRA was a primary cause of the housing debacle. None of the articles mention - anywhere - the volume and the scale of the borrowing through the CRA and nor subsequent default rates. Now, in the first posts in the thread, we know. It was less than 10%. Pointing out that the government mandated risky lending through the CRA does not anywhere prove causality. The empirical evidence is that it was not.

The Link has been provided. It is the one that leads to the CRA.

READ IT. If you are going to deny that the CRA dealt with Packaging Mortgages then it is CLEAR you have not read the CRA.

not only did it pressure banks into lending more to low income people. It spelled out to Freddy and Fanny how they could package said Mortgages and put them on the market as a way to make the whole plan work.

However the CRA is just a part of the problem.

You also have Clinton Removing the Regulations on banks as to how much of peoples savings could be invested into the stock market, and lowered the amount Banks had to keep on hand in respect to how much money they had from Depositors. Those regulations had been put in place after the Depression to avoid it re occurring.

Those are just 2 of several factors that lead to this problem.

All you have to do is actually read the act to know that Care4.

It should also be noted in the links provided that the criticism was that "the government forced lending through the GSEs via the CRA." The articles leave the impression that the CRA was a primary cause of the housing debacle. None of the articles mention - anywhere - the volume and the scale of the borrowing through the CRA and nor subsequent default rates. Now, in the first posts in the thread, we know.

The interesting links indicate multiple cause, and I tend to agree. I don't agree that the CRA is without a major partof the blame.

CRA was a force behind the following:
WASHINGTON  Top executives at mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ignored warnings that they were taking on too many risky loans years before the housing market plunged, according to documents released Tuesday by a House committee.

E-mails and other internal documents released by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee show that former Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd and former Freddie Mac CEO Richard Syron disregarded recommendations that they stay away from riskier types of loans.

"Their irresponsible decisions are now costing the taxpayers billions of dollars," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, which reviewed nearly 400,000 internal documents from Fannie and Freddie.

And this from the NYTimes:
In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.

And check this out:
The CRA forces banks to make loans in poor communities, loans that banks may otherwise reject as financially unsound. Under the CRA, banks must convince a set of bureaucracies that they are not engaging in discrimination, a charge that the act encourages any CRA-recognized community group to bring forward. Otherwise, any merger or expansion the banks attempt will likely be denied. But what counts as discrimination?

There are two issues here. First is Fannie and Freddie. Nobody is saying that Fannie and Freddie were not a systemic risk to the financial system. Clearly, they were. But the criticism is in the wrong direction. The criticism is not that Fannie and Freddie made bad loans. The issue is that Fannie and Freddie weren't capitalized well enough. The amount of capital the GSEs had on their balance sheets to support all their loans was 2%. That's nuts. If their portfolio falls 2%, they are effectively insolvent. If you are looking for a Democratic scapegoat, this is as good as any since the Democrats were the primary enabler of the GSE. However, it should be noted that when the GOP controlled every facet of government from 2002 to 2006 - when all this bad debt was being built up on their balance sheets - they chose to turn their heads and do nothing. It should also be noted that it wasn't just Freddie and Fannie that were not well capitalized enough. It was also Lehman, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Wachovia, IndyMac, AIG, and many other financial institutions, all of whom were not government entities! In this sense, the GSEs were behaving like their private market competitors.

Yes Very good points.

I think we need to stop this blame game shit, and think about Obama's plan to fix things, and ask ourselves does it make sense.

I am inclined to think it does not, but that is just my opinion. I think in Effect Obama's plan is simply seeking to artificially keep the over inflated prices of Houses up. Having Built many houses from 2004 to 2007, I found they were way way way over priced in general. The simple fact is most of these homes were never worth what was payed for them, or even half of it in many cases. So trying to stop the fall of housing values is artificially trying to keep those over priced homes, over priced.

It is a plan to stimulate spending by consumers.

Then its an attempt to keep some of the people in their houses long enough for a recoverey. The prices will go back up in a normal economy.

Just the beginning:

<quote>
I explained to [Congressman Jerry McNerney (D-Pleasanton)] that even people who make $150k in Northern Cal. are not rich and should not be taxed as if they wereI also expressed my concern that about half the people in the country now pay no income taxes, so there is overwhelming incentive for them to keep voting for democrats and therefore higher taxes for the rest of us. He told me that he thought tax rates should go up for the very rich and that the top marginal tax rate should be 90%. I couldnt believe what I was hearing, so I asked in a voice that many in the room could hear if he really meant 90%, and he said yes. Several people asked me after my turn was over if they heard correctly what he said, and were amazed when I said yes.

I also asked how a congress that was very critical of republican ethics and vowed change could justify letting Rangel, Dodd, and Murtha keep their committee chairmanships with their obvious ethical issues. His response was that Republicans ethics were worse because of their unjustified aggressive war.

This is just my small example of the anger and frustration of people in liberal Northern California.

Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending
by STEVEN A. HOLMES
Published: September 30, 1999

In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.

The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets  including the New York metropolitan region  will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring.

Fannie Mae, the nations biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.

In moving, even tentatively, into this new area of lending, Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.

From the perspective of many people, including me, this is another thrift industry growing up around us, said Peter Wallison a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. If they fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry....

Well, I think President Bush's initiative of Home Ownership was admirable, and do believe for the most part, that owning a home makes one take ownership in their community, moreso than if a renter.

But i would not give him a complete pass in this mess...seems like this whole thing rings of what can go wrong, will go wrong...and anyone with even a fingertip in it....did things wrongly....?

G.W. Bush on the Housing Boom - Oct. 2002

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, all. Thanks, for coming. Well, thanks for the warm welcome. Thank you for being here today. I appreciate your attendance to this very important conference. You see, we want everybody in America to own their own home. Thats what we want. This is - an ownership society is a compassionate society.

More and more people own their homes in America today. Two-thirds of all Americans own their homes, yet we have a problem here in America because few than half of the Hispanics and half the African Americans own the home. Thats a homeownership gap. Its a - its a gap that weve got to work together to close for the good of our country, for the sake of a more hopeful future. Weve got to work to knock down the barriers that have created a homeownership gap.

I set an ambitious goal. Its one that I believe we can achieve. Its a clear goal, that by the end of this decade well increase the number of minority homeowners by at least 5.5 million families. (Applause.)

Some may think thats a stretch. I dont think it is. I think it is realistic. I know were going to have to work together to achieve it. But when we do our communities will be stronger and so will our economy. Achieving the goal is going to require some good policies out of Washington. And its going to require a strong commitment from those of you involved in the housing industry.
CONTINUED....
I told Mel Martinez I was serious about this initiative. We started talking about it and I said, well, you know, Im the kind of fellow, I dont like to lay out a goal and dont mean it. I think its not - I dont think its fair for the American people to be - to have a President or anybody else, for that matter, lay out a goal and just kind of say it, but dont mean it. I mean it. And the good news is, Mel Martinez believes it and means it, as well. Hes doing a fine job of running HUD, and Im glad he has joined my Cabinet. (Applause.)

CONTINUED...

All of us here in America should believe, and I think we do, that we should be, as I mentioned, a nation of owners. Owning something is freedom, as far as Im concerned. Its part of a free society. And ownership of a home helps bring stability to neighborhoods. You own your home in a neighborhood, you have more interest in how your neighborhood feels, looks, whether its safe or not. It brings pride to people, its a part of an asset-based to society. It helps people build up their own individual portfolio, provides an opportunity, if need be, for a mom or a dad to leave something to their child. Its a part of - its of being a - its a part of - an important part of America.

Homeownership is also an important part of our economic vitality. If - when we meet this project, this goal, according to our Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, we will have added an additional $256 billion to the economy by encouraging 5.5 million new home owners in America; the activity - the economic activity stimulated with the additional purchasers, the additional buyers, the additional demand will be upwards of $256 billion. And thats important because it will help people find work.

Low interest rates, low inflation are very important foundations for economic growth. The idea of encouraging new homeownership and the money that will be circulated as a result of people purchasing homes will mean people are more likely to find a job in America. This project not only is good for the soul of the country, its good for the pocketbook of the country, as well.

To open up the doors of homeownership there are some barriers, and I want to talk about four that need to be overcome. First, down payments. A lot of folks cant make a down payment. They may be qualified. They may desire to buy a home, but they dont have the money to make a down payment. I think if you were to talk to a lot of families that are desirous to have a home, they would tell you that the down payment is the hurdle that they cant cross. And one way to address that is to have the federal government participate.

And so weve called upon Congress to set up whats called the American Dream Down Payment Fund, which will provide financial grants to local governments to help first-time home buyers who qualify to make the down payment on their home. If a down payment is a problem, theres a way we can address that. And when Congress funds the program, this should help 200,000 new families over the next five years become first-time home buyers.

Secondly, affordable housing is a problem in many neighborhoods, particularly inner-city neighborhoods. You may - we may have qualified home buyers, but if theres no home to buy, this initiative isnt going anywhere. And so one of the things that were going to - that Im doing is proposing a single-family affordable housing credit to encourage the construction of single-family homes in neighborhoods where affordable housing is scarce. (Applause.)

Over the next five years the initiative will provide home builders and therefore home buyers with - home builders with $2 billion in tax credits to bring affordable homes and therefore provide an additional supply for home buyers. Its really important for us to understand that we can provide incentive for people to build homes where theres a lack of affordable housing.

And weve got to set priorities. And one of the key priorities is going to be inner-city America. Good schools and affordable housing will help revitalize our inner cities.

CONTINUED...

And, of course, one of the larger obstacles to minority homeownership is financing, is the ability to have their dream financed. Right now, we have a program that all of you are familiar with, maybe our fellow Americans are, and thats what they call a Section 8 housing program, that provides billions of dollars in vouchers to help low-income Americans with their rent. It encourages leasing. We think its important that we use those vouchers, that federal money to help low-income Americans go from being somebody who leases to somebody who owns; that we use the Section 8 program to not only help with down payment, but to help with continuing monthly mortgage payments after theyre into their new home. It is a - it is a way to help us meet this dream of 5.5 million additional families owning their home.

Im also going to encourage the lending industry to develop a mortgage market so that this script, these vouchers, can regularly be used as a source of payment to provide more capital to lenders, who can then help more families move from rental housing into houses of their own.

These are some of the barriers that home owners face, potential home owners face, and this is what we intend to do about it. But like in a lot of our life, government cant do everything. Its impossible to provide every aspect of a national strategy, particularly in this case. And thats why we need the help of private and nonprofit sectors in our country to help play a vital role in helping to meet the goal. Many of you here represent the nonprofit, as well as the private sectors of our economy and our country, and I want to thank you for your commitment.

Last June, I issued a challenge to everyone involved in the housing industry to help increase the number of minority families to be home owners. And what Im talking about, Im talking about your bankers and your brokers and developers, as well as members of faith-based community and community programs. And the response to the home owners challenge has been very strong and very gratifying. Twenty-two public and private partners have signed up to help meet our national goal. Partners in the mortgage finance industry are encouraging homeownership by purchasing more loans made by banks to African Americans, Hispanics and other minorities.

Representatives of the real estate and homebuilding industries, through their nationwide networks or affiliates, are committed to broadening homeownership. They made the commitment to help meet the national goal we set.

Freddie Mae - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - I see the heads who are here; I want to thank you all for coming - (laughter) - have committed to provide more money for lenders. Theyve committed to help meet the shortage of capital available for minority home buyers.

Fannie Mae recently announced a $50 million program to develop 600 homes for the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Franklin, I appreciate that commitment. They also announced $12.7 million investment in a condominium project in Harlem. Its the beginnings of a series of initiatives to help meet the goal of 5.5 million families. Franklin told me at the meeting where we kicked this office, he said, I promise you we will help, and he has, like many others in this room have done.

Freddie Mac recently began 25 initiatives around the country to dismantle barriers and create greater opportunities for homeownership. One of the programs is designed to help deserving families who have bad credit histories to qualify for homeownership loans. Freddie Mac is also working with the Department of Defense to promote construction and financing for housing for men and women in the military.

Theres all kinds of ways that we can work together to meet the goal. Corporate America has a responsibility to work to make America a compassionate place. Corporate America has responded. As an example - only one of many examples - the good folks at Sears and Roebuck have responded by making a five-year, $100 million commitment to making homeownership and home maintenance possible for millions of Americans.

There have been other steps that are being taken to close the homeownership gap. And youve heard some of the stories here today, people much more eloquent than me, to talk about whats taking place on the front line of meeting this national goal.

The non-profit groups are bringing homeownership to some of our most troubled communities. And as you know, Im a strong advocate of what I call the faith-based initiative. And the reason I am is because I understand the universal call to love a neighbor like youd like to be loved yourself, and that includes helping somebody find a home.

One such example is the Enterprise Foundation, a national non-profit organization that provides assistance to grassroots homeownership organizations. Because of their work, as one example, 185 affordable homes will be available in the Baltimore neighborhood that was once so crime-ridden that people had written it off. Revitalizing neighborhoods is a real possibility if people put their mind to it. And at the same time, youre helping people own a home in America.

CONTINUED...

So I want to thank you all for coming. I want to thank you for your determination to help close the minority homeownership gap. Its an incredibly important initiative for this country. See, America is a good and generous country. Its a great place. Part of it was to make sure that the dream, the American Dream, the ability to come from anywhere in our society and say, I own this home, is a reality - can be achievable for anybody, regardless of their status, regardless of their - of whether or not they - whether or not they think the dream is meant for them.

I mean, we can put light where theres darkness, and hope where theres despondency in this country. And part of it is working together as a nation to encourage folks to own their own home.

Again, I want to tell you, this is an initiative - as Mel will tell you, its an initiative that we take very seriously. Were going to stay on it until were - until we achieve the goal. And as we all achieve the goal, we can look back and say, America is a better place for our hard work, our efforts and our desires for our fellow Americans to realize the greatness of our country.

Thank you for coming. May God bless your vision. May God bless America. (Applause.)

<quote>
But the story of how the United States got here is partly one of Bush's own making, according to a review of his tenure that included interviews with dozens of current and former administration officials.

From his earliest days in office, Bush paired his belief that Americans do best when they own their own homes with his conviction that markets do best when left alone. Bush pushed hard to expand home ownership, especially among minority groups, an initiative that dovetailed with both his ambition to expand Republican appeal and the business interests of some of his biggest donors. But his housing policies and hands-off approach to regulation encouraged lax lending standards.

Bush did foresee the danger posed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance giants. The president spent years pushing a recalcitrant Congress to toughen regulation of the companies, but was unwilling to compromise when his former Treasury secretary wanted to cut a deal. And the regulator Bush chose to oversee them - an old school buddy - pronounced the companies sound even as they headed toward insolvency.

As early as 2006, top advisers to Bush dismissed warnings from people inside and outside the White House that housing prices were inflated and that a foreclosure crisis was looming. And when the economy deteriorated, Bush and his team misdiagnosed the reasons and scope of the downturn. As recently as February, for example, Bush was still calling it a "rough patch."

The result was a series of piecemeal policy prescriptions that lagged behind the escalating crisis.

"There is no question we did not recognize the severity of the problems," said Al Hubbard, Bush's former chief economic adviser, who left the White House in December 2007. "Had we, we would have attacked them."

Looking back, Keith Hennessey, Bush's current chief economic adviser, said he and his colleagues had done the best they could "with the information we had at the time." But Hennessey did say he regretted that the administration had not paid more heed to the dangers of easy lending practices.

And both Paulson and his predecessor, John Snow, say the housing push went too far.

"The Bush administration took a lot of pride that home ownership had reached historic highs," Snow said during an interview. "But what we forgot in the process was that it has to be done in the context of people being able to afford their house. We now realize there was a high cost."

For much of the Bush presidency, the White House was preoccupied by terrorism and war; on the economic front, its pressing concerns were cutting taxes and privatizing Social Security, a government retirement and disability benefits program. The housing market was a bright spot: Ever-rising home values kept the economy humming, as owners drew down on their equity to buy consumer goods and pack their children off to college.

Assume arguendo that CRA legislation forced banks into making high risk, ill advised loans. And, lets further assume a huge percentage of these government mandated mortgages have gone bad. The buyers who could not legitimately afford these homes or otherwise qualify for other mortgages have defaulted, and these houses are either in default, foreclosure or REOs.

What would this alternative nation look like?

Given the giant US housing boom and bust, this thought experiment would have several obvious and inevitable outcomes from CRA forced lending:

1) Home sales in CRA communities would have led the national home market higher, with sales gains (as a percentage) increasing even more than the national median;

2) Prices of CRA funded properties should have risen even more than the rest of the nation as sales ramped up.

3) After the market peaked and reversed, Distressed Sales in CRA regions should lead the national market downwards. Foreclosures and REOS should be much higher in CRA neighborhoods than the national median.

4) We should have reams of evidence detailing how CRA mandated loans have defaulted in vastly disproportionate numbers versus the national default rates;

5) CRA Banks that were funding these mortgages should be failing in ever greater numbers, far more than the average bank;

6) Portfolios of large national TARP banks should be strewn with toxic CRA defaults; securitizers that purchased these mortgages should have compiled list of defaulted CRA properties;

7) Bank execs likely would have been complaining to the Bush White House from 2002-08 about these CRA mandates; The many finance executives who testified to Congress, would also have spelled out that CRA was a direct cause, with compelling evidence backing their claims.

So much for THAT thought experiment: None of these outcomes have occurred.

Zero.

In reality, the precise opposite of what a CRA-induced collapse should have looked like is what occurred. The 345 mortgage brokers that imploded were non-banks, not covered by the CRA legislation. The vast majority of CRA covered banks are actually healthy.

The biggest foreclosure areas arent Harlem or Chicagos South side or DC slums or inner city Philly; Rather, it hs been non-CRA regions  the Sand States  such as southern California, Las Vegas, Arizona, and South Florida. The closest thing to an inner city foreclosure story is Detroit  and maybe the bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler actually had something to do with that.

You CON$ just make this crap up out of thin air!
CRA loans were for 1% over prime, and while that technically made them subprime loans, they were not the high interest, high gain, high risk ARM loans that would be part of the security packages that caused the problems. Furthermore, if the borrower makes his or her monthly payments on time for two years, the one percentage point premium is dropped, so CRA ARMs were adjusted DOWN making them even more unlikely to be part of the packages.

7) Bank execs likely would have been complaining to the Bush White House from 2002-08 about these CRA mandates; The many finance executives who testified to Congress, would also have spelled out that CRA was a direct cause, with compelling evidence backing their claims.

So much for THAT thought experiment: None of these outcomes have occurred.

Zero.

In reality, the precise opposite of what a CRA-induced collapse should have looked like is what occurred. The 345 mortgage brokers that imploded were non-banks, not covered by the CRA legislation. The vast majority of CRA covered banks are actually healthy.

The biggest foreclosure areas arent Harlem or Chicagos South side or DC slums or inner city Philly; Rather, it hs been non-CRA regions  the Sand States  such as southern California, Las Vegas, Arizona, and South Florida. The closest thing to an inner city foreclosure story is Detroit  and maybe the bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler actually had something to do with that.

</quote>
Selecting one item, the CRA out of the plethora of policies instituted by the Democrats is certainly one way of winning the argument. It is akin to the Global Warming fanatics selecting a short time period for their 'proof.'

Look at the incrimental progression toward financial crisis:

"For as homeownership grew, so did the rate of foreclosures. From just 2 percent of commercial bank mortgages in 1922, they rose to 9 percent in 1926 and to 11 percent in 1927. Soon after the October 1929 Wall Street crash, the housing market began to collapse: panicked depositors withdrew money from their accounts, prompting bank runs; the banks ran out of capital and stopped making loans; and the mortgage market seized up. Homeowners, who in that era typically had short-term mortgages that required several refinancings before being paid off, suddenly couldnt find new loans. Defaults explodedby 1933, some 1,000 homes were foreclosing every day.

The feds responded to the crisis with the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), a New Deal bailout program that made government an even bigger player in the housing market. The HOLC eventually received 1.9 million applications for mortgages and approved 1 million. Despite the more favorable terms that the HOLC offered, however, about one-fifth of the new mortgages defaulted, a failure rate that would sink a private-sector bank.
The Depression-era federal government created many other institutions to fix flaws in the mortgage market: the Federal Home Loan Bank system to provide a stable source of funds for banks; the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to insure mortgages; the Federal National Mortgage Association (later known as Fannie Mae) to purchase those insured mortgages; and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to prevent future bank runs.

By the end of the Great Depression, the U.S. government had become the dominant force in the mortgage market. Politicians could now use that regulated market to advance their own policy agendasor their careers. Many housing experts of the time warned against this politicization, anticipating what was to come. Liberal housing advocate Charles Abrams, for example, publicly worried that as the Depression lifted, yet more new government plans to encourage homeownership would lure unsuspecting and unqualified lower-income families into the housing market. The foundation of a stable economic system, Abrams argued, wasnt a large percentage of homeowning families, as Hoover contended; it was how sound the ownership is. But as homeownership grew, political pressure to allow riskier loans increased, tooexactly what Abrams had cautioned against.

Under pressure to keep meeting housing demand, the government began loosening its mortgage-lending standardscutting the size of required down payments, approving loans with higher ratios of payments to income, and extending the terms of mortgages. By attracting riskier home buyers, these moves provoked a surge in foreclosures on government-backed mortgages. The failure rate on FHA-insured loans spiked fivefold from 1950 to 1960, according to a 1970 National Bureau of Economic Research study, while the failure rate on mortgages made through the Veterans Administration nearly doubled over the same period. By contrast, the foreclosure rate of conventional mortgages barely increased, since many traditional lenders had maintained stricter underwriting standards

The FHAs urban-loan debacle of the 1960s and early seventies, its most ruinous lending mistake yet: politicians in both parties argued that extending the American dream of homeownership to poor and to immigrantswould stabilize urban communities and prevent further violence. So in 1968, the federal government passed a law giving poor families FHA-insured loans that required down payments of as little as $250. Not urban uplift but urban nightmare followed. In the end, the government absorbed an estimated $1.4 billion in losses nationwide.
The meltdown couldnt have happened without Washingtons unexamined assumption that homeownership would transform the lives of low-income buyers in positive ways. The program could not work because it tried to solve a problem of wealth creation through debt creation, Harvard historian Louis Hyman recently observed, aptly comparing the FHA scandals with todays subprime crisis.
Next the governments spur to action was claims by housing and civil rights activists that banks were redliningintentionally not lending in minority neighborhoods. Studies by advocacy groups and local newspapers purported to prove that redlining was real. Black neighborhoods, the studies showed, received far fewer mortgages than mostly white areas did, and black applicants had their loans shot down more often than whites with similar incomes. Banks and academic experts responded that the studies didnt include information about the creditworthiness of borrowers in black neighborhoods, a more important factor than income. Nevertheless, the media worked themselves into a frenzy, pillorying government officials who dared object to the studies conclusions.

a. Congress passed a bill in 1975 requiring banks to provide the government with information on their lending activities in poor urban areas. Two years later, it passed the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which gave regulators the power to deny banks the right to expand if they didnt lend sufficiently in those neighborhoods. In 1979 the FDIC used the CRA to block a move by the Greater NY Savings Bank for not enough lending.

b. In 1986, when the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn) threatened to oppose an acquisition by a southern bank, Louisiana Bancshares, until it agreed to new flexible credit and underwriting standards for minority borrowersfor example, counting public assistance and food stamps as income.

c. In 1987, Acorn led a coalition of advocacy groups calling for industry-wide changes in lending standards. Among the demanded reforms were the easing of minimum down-payment requirements and of the requirement that borrowers have enough cash at a closing to cover two to three months of mortgage payments (research had shown that lack of money in hand was a big reason some mortgages failed quickly).

d. ACORN then attacked Fannie Mae, the giant quasi-government agency that bought loans from banks in order to allow them to make new loans. Its underwriters were strictly by-the-book interpreters of lending standards and turned down purchases of unconventional loans, charged Acorn. The pressure eventually paid off. In 1992, Congress passed legislation requiring Fannie Mae and the similar Freddie Mac to devote 30 percent of their loan purchases to mortgages for low- and moderate-income borrowers.

e. Clinton Administration housing secretary, Henry Cisneros, declared that he would expand homeownership among lower- and lower-middle-income renters. His strategy: pushing for no-down-payment loans; expanding the size of mortgages that the government would insure against losses; and using the CRA and other lending laws to direct more private money into low-income programs.

f. Shortly after Cisneros announced his plan, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreed to begin buying loans under new, looser guidelines. Freddie Mac, for instance, started approving low-income buyers with bad credit histories or none at all, so long as they were current on rent and utilities payments. Freddie Mac also said that it would begin counting income from seasonal jobs and public assistance toward its income minimum, despite the FHA disaster of the sixties.

g. Freddie Mac began an alternative qualifying program with the Sears Mortgage Corporation that let a borrower qualify for a loan with a monthly payment as high as 50 percent of his income, at a time when most private mortgage companies wouldnt exceed 33 percent. The program also allowed borrowers with bad credit to get mortgages if they took credit-counseling classes administered by Acorn and other nonprofits. Subsequent research would show that such classes have little impact on default rates.

h. Pressuring nonbank lenders to make more loans to poor minorities didnt stop with Sears. If it didnt happen, Clinton officials warned, theyd seek to extend CRA regulations to all mortgage makers. In Congress, Representative Maxine Waters called financial firms not covered by the CRA among the most egregious redliners.

i. Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) shocked the financial world by signing a 1994 agreement with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), pledging to increase lending to minorities and join in new efforts to rewrite lending standards. The first MBA member to sign up: Countrywide Financial, the mortgage firm that would be at the core of the subprime meltdown.

j. A 1998 sales pitch by a Bear Stearns managing director advised banks to begin packaging their loans to low-income borrowers into securities that the firm could sell. Forget traditional underwriting standards when considering these loans, the director advised. For a low-income borrower, he continued in all-too-familiar terms, owning a home was a near-sacred obligation. A family will do almost anything to meet that monthly mortgage payment. Bunk, says Stan Liebowitz, a professor of economics at the University of Texas: The claim that lower-income homeowners are somehow different in their devotion to their home is a purely emotional claim with no evidence to support it.

k. Any concern was quickly dismissed. When in early 2000 the FDIC proposed increasing capital requirements for lenders making subprime loansloans to people with questionable credit, that isDemocratic representative Carolyn Maloney of New York told a congressional hearing that she feared that the step would dry up CRA loans. Her fellow New York Democrat John J. LaFalce urged regulators not to be premature in imposing new regulations.

l. In July 1999, HUD proposed new levels for Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs low-income lending; in September, Fannie Mae agreed to begin purchasing loans made to borrowers with slightly impaired creditthat is, with credit standards even lower than the government had been pushing for a generation.

m. In 2004 Congress pressed new affordable-housing goals on the two mortgage giants, which through 2007 purchased some $1 trillion in loans to lower- and moderate-income buyers. The buying spree helped spark a massive increase in securitization of mortgages to people with dubious credit.

n. In October 1994, Fannie Mae head James Johnson had reminded a banking convention that mortgages with small down payments had a much higher risk of defaulting. (A Duff &amp; Phelps study found that they were nearly three times more likely to default than conventional mortgages.) Yet the very next month, Fannie Mae said that it expected to back loans to low-income home buyers with a 97 percent loan-to-value ratiothat is, loans in which the buyer puts down just 3 percentas part of a commitment, made earlier that year to Congress, to purchase $1 trillion in affordable-housing mortgages by the end of the nineties. According to Edward Pinto, who served as the companys chief credit officer, the program was the result of political pressure on Fannie Mae trumping lending standards.

o. In 1992, the Boston Fed produced an extraordinary 29-page document that codified the new lending wisdom. Conventional mortgage criteria, the report argued, might be unintentionally biased because they didnt take into account the economic culture of urban, lower-income and nontraditional customers. Lenders should thus consider junking the industrys traditional income-to-payments ratio and stop viewing an applicants lack of credit history as a negative factor. Further, if applicants had bad credit, banks should consider extenuating circumstanceseven though a study by mortgage insurance companies would soon show, not surprisingly, that borrowers with no credit rating or a bad one were far more likely to default. If applicants didnt have enough savings for a down payment, the Boston Fed urged, banks should allow loans from nonprofits or government assistance agencies to count toward one. A later study of Freddie Mac mortgages would find that a borrower who made a down payment with third-party funds was four times more likely to default, a reminder that traditional underwriting standards werent arbitrary but based on historical lending patterns.

p. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus launched Hogar in 2003, an initiative that pushed for easing lending standards for immigrants, including touting so-called seller-financed mortgages in which a builder provided down-payment aid to buyers via contributions to nonprofit groups. As a result, mortgage lending to Hispanics soared. And today, in districts where Hispanics make up at least 25 percent of the population, foreclosure rates are now nearly 50 percent higher than the national average, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.

q. Republicans and Democrats, meanwhile, have scrambled to reignite the housing market through ill-conceived tax credits and renewed federal subsidies for mortgages, including the Obama administrations mortgage bailout plan, which recalls the New Deals HOLC. Behind these efforts is a fundamental misconception among politicians that housing drives the American economy and therefore demands subsidy at virtually any cost.

Our praiseworthy initial effortsto eliminate housing discrimination and provide all Americans an equal opportunity to buy a homewere eventually turned on their heads by advocates and politicians, who instead tried to ensure equality of outcomes."

No one is arguing that the government did not have an effect on the mortgage market. You simply cannot be as big as the government was in the mortgage market and not have some effect.

But again, here are a few simple facts

- homes guaranteed by Freddie and Fannie have fallen less in price and have defaulted at a lower rate.
- homes owned in minority communities rose at a lesser rate and have had a lesser rate of defaults than those in basically white and middle to upper class neighborhoods.

Thus, pinning the GSEs or other minority programs as the cause of this debacle, or even a primary cause, does not wash out with what has actually occurred in the mortgage and housing markets.

This debacle occurred because middle and upper class people thought they could speculate in homes and use their houses as ATMs, levering up their balance sheets to do so. Expanding home ownership certainly had some effect but is dwarfed by the speculation that occurred in the better neighborhoods.

What I am saying is that if the minority programs had a disproportionate effect on the housing markets and the subsequent collapse, as is being alleged, there would have been disproportionate effects in minority and lower-income neighborhoods. If disproportionate amounts of credit came flooding into these neighborhoods, then there would have been disproportionate increases and declines in housing prices and disproportionate amount of foreclosures in these neighborhoods.

But that did not happen.

Instead, the largest effects were and still are in the suburbs and the middle to upper income neighborhoods, particularly in the sunbelt. The worst effects were in Florida, Arizona and California as well as Nevada. The first three have historically been more boom/bust because people speculate more in these states as people buy a dream - or perceive others as wanting to buy a dream - of living in warm, sunny climates. Nevada became more prominent as the state fits this profile and Las Vegas has grown larger.

Not many poor black people buying six condos speculating on the Strip.

Right. So the minority programs only had a tangential effect on the credit crisis.

However, mortgage standards were lowered significantly. I wish I had the link but I can't find it, but there was a story in the St Pete Times three years ago about a homeless guy of no fixed address, who had no job and had no known assets, who died on the streets of Tampa. They found in his possession the deeds for five homes he purchased with mortgages he had received from various banks in the Tampa Bay region. Four of the homes had been foreclosed but one was still current.

Most CRA loans were made in poorer, minority neighborhoods. The intent was to stop racial discrimination. Banks would "redline" neighborhoods, meaning they would take a red marker and "redline" off neighborhoods - primarily minority - where they would not make loans, even if people in the neighborhoods were creditworthy.

Whether or not you agree with this, or if the CRA program went beyond it's original intent, the point here is that CRA loans and other minority programs contributed little to the financial crisis.

Hi Toro:

<quote orig_author="Toro">
"CRA Not to Blame For Housing Debacle"

The idea that the CRA was a big contributor to the housing debacle keeps popping up. Thus, I'm creating a new thread to refute this assertion...
</quote>
This is more El Toro nonsense that seeks to prove a negative thesis using very few facts to support anything. BTW, Toro is hypothesizing about the Community Reinvestment Act ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act">Wiki</a> ) that has been changed/revised over and over and over again to beat banks over the head with increasing 'obligations' and 'responsibilities' in a what has become a 'deflationary housing market.' To accurately understand the "Housing Debacle," then forget about banking regulations and move over to the 'Consumer Base' side of the equation:

The Housing/Mortgage/Foreclosure/Credit Crisis is a symptom of the Outsourcing/HB-1 Visa-Guest Worker/Illegal Alien Foreign National/Bankruptcy Crisis created by the ‘displacement’ of U.S. Workers from the Local Market Place. Jobs are being shipped overseas at record pace with the NAFTA Stupidity (export of manufacturing base) and Outsourcing of Service Sector JOBS to India and all over God’s Green Earth. One and a half MILLION Foreign Nationals are shipped into the USA for the sole purpose of ‘displacing’ U.S. Workers from JOBS, which means your Consumer Base is taking another hit and fewer buyers are in the local market to make an offer on your home. Then add 20 to 30 Million Illegal Alien Foreign Nationals to the mix and worker ‘displacement’ sees U.S. Workers playing musical chairs with fewer and fewer JOBS and 70 percent of the GDP takes yet another hit. All of these factors have been worked into the U.S. Consumer Base Stew Pot, until the Economic and Tax Base are destroyed and local governments are forced to lay off even more Federal, State and County workers in an already-flooded unemployment situation where 900 workers are applying for 20 JOBS.

There is “NO BOTTOM” in the local housing markets, because the U.S. Consumer Base has been effectively destroyed, which is the reason that the banks and insurance companies and automakers went bust and needed a bailout in the first place. Commercial Real Estate is the next shoe to drop, which Gerald Celente explains in this video:

The U.S. Economy Imploded last fall (Sept. 18 – October), so the FED and U.S. Treasury have been bailing their buddies out using inflationary paper that was created out of thin air to create the current “Bailout Bubble.” All of this Stimulus Hype is all about continuing to inflate the Bailout Bubble, until the U.S. Economy finally “Officially Implodes” at some point this fall. Obama is carrying on with the Bushie Bailout Fiasco, because they work for the New World Order Puppeteers now bringing in their New World Order Fascist State and all of Toro’s talk about banking regulation has nothing to do with anything at all.

No bottom in the housing market means no bottom in the stock markets, which the day traders will eventually wake up and understand just before the Coming Collapse 2009 ( <a href="http://www.usmessageboard.com/conspiracy-theories/76652-surviving-the-economic-collapse-2009-a.html">my Topic</a> ).

Want to try again?

"This was a market failure, we are told, and the promise of capitalism has always been that the self-correcting mechanisms built into the system would preclude the possibility of a systemic market failure.

But the housing bubble only burst after government subsidies pushed house prices up so fast that marginal buyers could no longer afford to chase prices even higher. A bubble created by rigged financial markets and a government-sponsored obsession with home ownership is not a result of market failure, but rather, a result of bad public policy. The belief that home ownership, per se, is such a benefit that no amount of government support could be too great and no pace at which home prices rise could be too fast is the root of the crisis.

There was no market failure.

During Bill Clinton's first term, government housing policy changed substantially. After decades in which liberal politicians and thinkers devoted themselves to arguments for expanding the number of public-housing units, the disastrous condition of those units led the President, a "new Democrat," to a dramatic ideological shift in emphasis. No longer would public housing be at the top of the liberal Democratic agenda. Instead, borrowing from conservative ideas about the inestimable benefit of home ownership to the striving poor, the Clinton administration and members of his party in the House and Senate decided to use government power to achieve that aim.

In 1994, the "National Homeownership Strategy" of the Clinton administration advanced "financing strategies fueled by creativity to help homeowners who lacked the cash to buy a home or the income to make the down payments" to buy a home nonetheless. It became U.S. government policy to intervene in the marketplace by lowering the standards necessary to qualify for mortgages so that Americans with lower incomes could participate in the leveraged purchases of homes.

The goal of expanding home ownership led to the creation of new mortgage subsidies across the board. The loosening of standards became the policy of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the pseudo-private "government-sponsored enterprises" that bought mortgages from originating lenders. A particular change in the tax law in 1997 encouraged many households to make buying and improving a home the primary vehicle by which they enhanced net worth. By eliminating any capital-gains tax on the first $500,000 of profits from the sale of an owner-occupied residence once every two years, Washington encouraged enterprising American families to purchase homes, fix them up, re-sell them, and then repeat the process. Flipping became a financial pastime for millions because this special advantage created a new incentivewhich didn't exactly fit the model of encouraging people to remain in a stable home for many years and thereby help to stabilize the neighborhood around them."

Now, for all of you who said banks could not be forced to give loans, get this:

"The housing bubble was thus a fully rational response to a set of distortions in the free marketdistortions created primarily by the public sector. The heads of large financial institutions, as Prince's remark suggested, recognized the risk-taking subsidy inherent in public policy, but felt they had no choice but to play along or fall behind the other institutions that were also responding rationally to the incentives created by government intervention.The housing collapse and its painful aftermath, including that $15 trillion wealth loss for U.S. households (so far), do not, therefore, represent a market failure. Rather, they represent the dangerous confluence of three policy errors: government policy aimed at providing access to home ownership for American households irrespective of their ability to afford it; the Fed's claim that it could not identify bubbles as they were inflating but could fix the problem afterward; and a policy of granting monopoly power to rating agencies like Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch's to determine the eligibility of derivative securities for what are supposed to be low-risk portfolios, such as pension funds."

"The long-term solution is for government to stop playing favorites, as it has for decades with housing. Home ownership should neither be penalized nor favored under government policy."

The problem with that argument is that there have been government subsidies for mortgages for 60 years.

Again, this is very simple, and no one arguing otherwise has yet to refute it: If this bubble was caused by government subsidies, then it would have been the homes that were government subsidized would have risen the furthest then crashed the hardest. That did not happen. In fact, the opposite happened. Homes financed with qualifying mortgages went up the least and have fallen the least. It is simple supply and demand. If government subsidies caused demand to increase disproportionately, then the increase would have been seen disproportionately in the prices for homes funded by government-funded mortgages. Instead, homes financed outside of government subsidization went up the most and crashed the hardest.

Government subsidies and government policy, mostly Democrat.

And, "government subsidies for mortgages for 60 years. "

I'll go you one decade better: how about 70 years- the GRE's go back to 1938.

In an earlier post I mentioned that, as economics is not a science, it is difficult to state when the other shoe will drop, or the efficacy of a policy will be seen- in totality... in this case we know: 70 years.

The last line in the article sums it up neatly.

This is a fascinating speech by William Black, a former banking regulator. It is long but it goes into many issues regarding the financial collapse and accompanying fraud.

At minute 62, he discusses the role of the CRA in the collapse, or the lack thereof. He notes that the CRA played an insignificant role for the following reasons.
- The CRA had been around for 30 years. It had not contributed to collapse before.
- 80% of the subprime loans had been made by non-regulated entities not subject to the CRA, so their behavior was not prompted by the CRA
- The institutions that were regulated by the CRA Act did not have any CRA-ratings problems with their loan books
- The CRA Act was watered down during this decade, not strengthened, particularly under Phil Gramm. Under Bush, regulators did not put any emphasis on enforcement of the CRA Act. He has great stories about how the S&amp;Ls bought the legislators in the 80s who tried to have regulators fired. The former CEO of Lincoln Savings - and a convicted fraudster criminal - discussed with a colleague having him killed.

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to expand mortgage lending in the communities in which they have branch offices, subject to maintaining overall levels of financial safety and soundness. Some have argued that this regulation forced banks to lower their credit standards and engage in riskier mortgage products in order to extend credit to lower-income individuals, who perhaps should not have received such loans. However, data provided by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) reveal that loans covered by the CRA accounted for only a fraction of mortgage lending to lower-income borrowers and neighborhoods. This is especially true of higher-priced, or subprime, mortgages. CRA assessment-area lending accounted for only nine percent of higher-priced loans to lower-income borrowers and neighborhoods, while independent mortgage companies accounted for the majority. Further, the subprime share of assessment-area loans made to lower-income borrowers and lower-income neighborhoods was lower than the subprime share for all loans made between 2004 and 2006....

In 1980, seventy-one percent of all one-to-four family home mortgages were originated by a deposit-taking bank or thrift. However, over the last several decades, innovations in capital markets enabled companies to raise capital by selling mortgage-backed securities into the secondary market. Without deposits, the CRA did not have the jurisdiction to regulate the new independent mortgage companies.

Independent mortgage companies accounted for the majority of one-to-four family mortgage loans by 1997, the last year that the Department of Housing and Urban Development conducted its Survey of Mortgage Lending Activity. In addition, much of the banks share flowed through their mortgage banking subsidiaries, where they are given the option whether or not to include mortgage originations in their CRA evaluations. Combined with the increasing ability of banks to lend outside their local communities, the share of loans made within CRA assessment-areas, has steadily declined over the last 15 years.

There are many causes to the collapse of the housing market and the recent financial turmoil, but the contribution of the CRA appears marginal. While banks did engage in subprime lending in their assessment areas, they did so at a lower rate than the market in general and accounted for only a small fraction of subprime loans to lower-income borrowers and lower income neighborhoods. The data suggest that far from being forced into risky corners of the market, the institutions under the scrutiny of the CRA were crowded out by unregulated lenders.

No one is getting it. The housing debacle is going to continue ladies and Gentleman while the CRA isn't responsible directly for the mess it is a contributor. My dad's first new house was 8 grand. The payment 80 dollars a month that was mid fifties. He mad a little more than 160 a weekat that time.

The point is this the same lending institutions that finance the home buyer are not infrequently through a different dept. the same banks that loan the builder the money to build those homes. Because the price of homes has been rising at alarming rates for the last fifty years. there has been tremendous pressure on the mortgage branch to find a buyer for those homes at any and all costs.

A few more articles.

First, there's the timing. CRA came in 1977. The crisis came in 2007. Indeed, by 2004, the Bush administration had weakened the CRA -- and after that (though not, presumably, because of it), bubble lending really took off. Further, CRA only governs a certain class of federally insured banks. Problem is, half of the subprime loans came from mortgage companies with no CRA involvement at all. Another 25%-30% came from companies with very little CRA exposure. For those who left their abacus at home, that's 80% of the loans which were fully or largely outside CRA jurisdiction. More than that, the non-CRA mortgage firms made subprime loans at twice the rate of CRA-covered firms. Which basically leaves a stake in the heart of this particular theory....

In the mid-1990s, new CRA regulations and a wave of mergers led to a flurry of CRA activity, but, as noted by the New America Foundation's Ellen Seidman (and by Harvard's Joint Center), that activity "largely came to an end by 2001." In late 2004, the Bush administration announced plans to sharply weaken CRA regulations, pulling small and mid-sized banks out from under the law's toughest standards. Yet sub-prime lending continued, and even intensified -- at the very time when activity under CRA had slowed and the law had weakened...

Subprime lending offered high-cost loans to the weakest borrowers during the housing boom that lasted from 2001 to 2007. Subprime lending was at its height from 2004 to 2006.

Federal Reserve Board data show that:

* More than 84 percent of the subprime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions.

* Private firms made nearly 83 percent of the subprime loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers that year.

* Only one of the top 25 subprime lenders in 2006 was directly subject to the housing law that's being lambasted by conservative critics.

...Between 2004 and 2006, when subprime lending was exploding, Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent, according to data from Inside Mortgage Finance, a specialty publication. One reason is that Fannie and Freddie were subject to tougher standards than many of the unregulated players in the private sector who weakened lending standards, most of whom have gone bankrupt or are now in deep trouble.

During those same explosive three years, private investment banks  not Fannie and Freddie  dominated the mortgage loans that were packaged and sold into the secondary mortgage market. In 2005 and 2006, the private sector securitized almost two thirds of all U.S. mortgages, supplanting Fannie and Freddie, according to a number of specialty publications that track this data.

In 1999, the year many critics charge that the Clinton administration pressured Fannie and Freddie, the private sector sold into the secondary market just 18 percent of all mortgages....

Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote recently that while the goal of the CRA was admirable, "it led to tremendous pressure on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  who in turn pressured banks and other lenders  to extend mortgages to people who were borrowing over their heads. That's called subprime lending. It lies at the root of our current calamity."

Fannie and Freddie, however, didn't pressure lenders to sell them more loans; they struggled to keep pace with their private sector competitors. In fact, their regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, imposed new restrictions in 2006 that led to Fannie and Freddie losing even more market share in the booming subprime market.

What's more, only commercial banks and thrifts must follow CRA rules. The investment banks don't, nor did the now-bankrupt non-bank lenders such as New Century Financial Corp. and Ameriquest that underwrote most of the subprime loans.

These private non-bank lenders enjoyed a regulatory gap, allowing them to be regulated by 50 different state banking supervisors instead of the federal government. And mortgage brokers, who also weren't subject to federal regulation or the CRA, originated most of the subprime loans.

In a speech last March, Janet Yellen, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, debunked the notion that the push for affordable housing created today's problems.

"Most of the loans made by depository institutions examined under the CRA have not been higher-priced loans," she said. "The CRA has increased the volume of responsible lending to low- and moderate-income households."

In a book on the sub-prime lending collapse published in June 2007, the late Federal Reserve Governor Ed Gramlich wrote that only one-third of all CRA loans had interest rates high enough to be considered sub-prime and that to the pleasant surprise of commercial banks there were low default rates. Banks that participated in CRA lending had found, he wrote, "that this new lending is good business."

Those arguing that the GSEs and the CRA were the cause of the housing bubble have yet to show any causal and empirical evidence. In fact, the causal and empirical evidence suggests otherwise.

<quote>
My approach to everything I have written, studied and analyzed in this space is pretty straight forward: Start with the data and evidence and go forward from there. Figure out what the Truth is; try to get as close to the objective reality beneath the noise in order to make intelligent investing decisions for myself and my clients.

There are others who do not share this objective. Their goals are either political (winning the next election) or ideological (having their belief system become dominant). Truth is irrelevant to these people.

Not surprisingly, these folks  many of whom contributed to the crisis in a mighty way  are desperately trying to duck responsibility for what happened. Those who helped cause the crisis are engaged in an ongoing effort to rewrite its history.

Their goal? Exonerate their own bad behavior, throw off any responsibility for the collapse, blame anything but their own ideology and horrific decision making. They want to keep pushing their tired political agendas, despite the damage they may have caused....

That lack of evidence, however, doesnt stop ideologues from trying. Consider this attempt at rewriting the causes of the credit crisis by Kevin Hassett:
The worst financial crisis in generations was set off by a massive government effort, led by the two mortgage giants, to make loans to homebuyers no matter whether they could make the payments. Lenders were willing to lend money to just about all comers, no matter how low their income. Why? Because the lenders knew Fannie and Freddie would purchase the loans from them for a high price before bundling them into securities to sell to investors. Now, this makes for a fascinating narrative that plays into a number of different ideological beliefs. It exonerates the radical free market deregulators, it ignores what the private sector did, and it somehow ignores the fact that Congress was controlled by a very conservative GOP from 1994 to 2006  the prime period of time covered leading up to and including the beginning of the crisis.

But worse than all of that, the data supporting Hassetts position simply isnt there.

Over the past 2 years, I have repeatedly asked the people who push this narrative to provide some evidence for their positions. I have offered a $100,000 if they could prove their case.

Specifically, I have requested some data or evidence that DISPROVED the following facts:
-The origination of subprime loans came primarily from non bank lenders not covered by the CRA;

-The majority of the underwriting, at least for the first few years of the boom, were by these same non-bank lenders

-When the big banks began chasing subprime, it was due to the profit motive, not any mandate from the President (a Republican) or the the Congress (Republican controlled) or the GSEs they oversaw.

-Prior to 2005, nearly all of these sub-prime loans were bought by Wall Street  NOT Fannie &amp; Freddie

-In fact, prior to 2005, the GSEs were not permitted to purchase non-conforming mortgages.

-After 2005, Fannie &amp; Freddie changed their own rules to start buying these non-conforming mortgages  in order to maintain market share and compete with Wall Street for profits.

-The change in FNM/FRE conforming mortgage purchases in 2005 was not due to any legislation or marching orders from the President (a Republican) or the the Congress (Republican controlled). It was the profit motive that led them to this action.... Of course, folks like Hassett hate this factual history, as it conflicts with their goals and politics. Rather than produce evidence, they create story lines unsupported by facts.

The biggest contributor to the Financial Crisis outside of the Fed was Wall Street, who securitized enormous amounts of crappy loans and packaged them to investors as "AAA" investments. As you can see here, Wall Street, i.e. "non-agency securitized" mortgages, dramatically gained market share at the expense of the GSEs, whose market share fell.

The volume of non-agency securitized loans went up by ~10x during the decade.

Here is the Fed study mentioned earlier in this thread absolving the CRA of responsibility for the Housing Bubble.

<quote>
Since 1995, there has been essentially no change in basic CRA rules or the enforcement process that can be reasonably linked to subprime lending activity....

Analysis of 2006 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data indicates that two-thirds of mortgage loans (first-lien home purchase and refinance loans for site-built properties) are entirely unrelated to CRA; these loans were extended to middle- or higher-income borrowers or to borrowers located outside of lower-income neighborhoods (table 1). These data also indicate that only ten percent of all loans are CRA-related  that is, lower-income loans made by banks and their affiliates in their CRA assessment areas.

More important for this discussion is CRAs relationship to subprime mortgage lending. As shown table 2, in 2005 and 2006, the peak years of subprime volume, independent mortgage companies (institutions not covered by the CRA) accounted for about half of all higher-priced loans (our proxy for subprime lending derived from HMDA data).
Also, 57 percent of all higher-priced loans in 2006 were effectively unrelated to CRA because they were made to non-lower-income borrowers or neighborhoods (table 3).

Most importantly, only 6 percent of all higher-priced loans in 2006 were made by CRA-covered institutions or their affiliates to lower-income borrowers or neighborhoods in their assessment areas. As noted, CRA performance evaluations focus on lower-income lending in CRA assessment areas....

This analysis indicates that subprime loans in zip codes that are the focus of the CRA (those just below the threshold) have performed slightly better and alt A loans in these areas slightly worse than those that are not (table 6)....

Another way to measure the likely effects of the CRA on the subprime crisis is by examining foreclosure activity across neighborhoods classified by income. Data made available by RealtyTrac on foreclosure filings from January 2006 through August 2008 indicates that most foreclosure filings (e.g. about 70 percent in 2006) have taken place in middle- or higher-income neighborhoods and that foreclosure filings have increased at a faster pace in middle- or higher-income areas than in lower-income areas that are the focus of the CRA (table 8).

Deregulation and industry capture certainly contributed to the crisis.

<quote>
The Fed was hardly alone in not pressing to clean up the mortgage industry. When states like Georgia and North Carolina started to pass tougher laws against abusive lending practices, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency successfully prohibited them from investigating local subsidiaries of nationally chartered banks.

Virtually every federal bank regulator was loathe to impose speed limits on a booming industry. But the regulators were also fragmented among an alphabet soup of agencies with splintered and confusing jurisdictions. Perhaps the biggest complication was that many mortgage lenders did not fall under any agencys authority at all....

by 2005, federal banking regulators were beginning to worry that mortgage lenders were running amok with exotic and often inscrutable new products....

Because each agency receives its funding from fees paid by the banks or thrifts they regulate, critics have long argued that they often treat the institutions they regulate as constituents to be protected. All of them are wary about stifling new financial services.

Regulators appointed by President Bush often have been more sympathetic to industry concerns about red tape than their Clinton administration predecessors. When James Gilleran, a former California banker and bank supervisor, took over the OTS in December 2001, he became known for his deregulatory zeal. At one press event in 2003, several bank regulators held gardening shears to represent their commitment to cut red tape for the industry. Mr. Gilleran brought a chain saw.

He also early on announced plans to slash expenses to resolve the agency's deficit; 20% of its work force eventually left. When he left in 2005, Mr. Gilleran declared that the OTS had "exercised increased diligence in its review of abusive consumer practices" while reducing thrifts' regulatory burden. But his successor, Mr. Reich, a former community banker, has reversed many of Mr. Gilleran's cuts. Citing "understaffing," he hired 80 examiners last year and plans to add 40 more this year.

This much is true. In an effort to promote affordable home ownership for minorities and rural whites, the Department of Housing and Urban Development set targets for Fannie and Freddie in 1992 to purchase low-income loans for sale into the secondary market that eventually reached this number: 52 percent of loans given to low-to moderate-income families....

But these loans, and those to low- and moderate-income families represent a small portion of overall lending....

Between 2004 and 2006, when subprime lending was exploding, Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent, according to data from Inside Mortgage Finance, a specialty publication.

CRA was not primarily responsible for the meltdown but it certainly gave regulators a figleaf with which to cover their mistakes in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. Without that figleaf a much smaller bust would have resulted. The 2004-6 bubble due to the trailing edge of the Baby Boom would have happened anyhow but with the CRA as an excuse for the regulators to goose the boom it got 2-3 times bigger than it needed to. So CRA was not the drunk but it sure was the main enabler.

The impetus for subprime came from the private sector

<quote>
Acemoglus assessment of recent research on lobbying is that parts of the private sector wanted financial rules to be relaxed  and worked hard and spent heavily to get this outcome. The impetus for a big subprime market came from within the private sector: innovation by giant mortgage lenders like Countrywide, Ameriquest, and many others, backed by the big investment banks....

The FCIC Republicans point the finger firmly at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises that supported housing loans by providing guarantees of various kinds. They are right that Fannie and Freddie were too big to fail, which enabled them to borrow more cheaply and take on more risk  with too little equity funding to back up their exposure.

But, while Fannie and Freddie jumped into dubious mortgages (particularly those known as Alt-A) and did some work with subprime lenders, this was relatively small stuff and late in the cycle (e.g., 2004-2005). The main impetus for the boom came from the entire machinery of private label securitization, which was just that: private. In fact, as Acemoglu points out, the powerful private-sector players consistently tried to marginalize Fannie and Freddie and exclude them from rapidly expanding market segments.

Yeah Toro but bending over and putting a big "kick me" sign on your butt is really stupid politics and that is exactly what the Ds did with CRA under Clinton and Carter. The Ds have a much bigger problem with their certifiably lunatic left coming up with the most screwball claims than the GOP even have nightmares about with the Tea Partiers denying pacts with Satan on TV. Then Obama gets two of the three stooges of the meltdown to stay on and do the same bang up job for him that they did for W. In the court of public opinion that is as good as a nolo contendre plea on causing the meltdown through the CRA.

So what? Clinton's HUD secretaries publicly claimed to set off the 1994-2006 construction and housing boom and therefore the meltdown by means of the CRA enforcement. That they were wrong does not change the fact that they set up policies based on the CRA that they said were intended to increase subprime loans to historic levels. If you google Cuomo or Cisneros and the CRA for when they were HUD secretaries you have to cherry pick to find statements that do not sound like the engineering of a housing bubble set to blow up under the next GOP president. That Bush and Greenspan were far more culpable is irrelevant. The Clinton administration was mired in shaky real estate deals from the get-go (Whitewater) and claimed total credit for the subprime boom before it really started. Please note my bend over and put a "Kick me" sign on your butt. I am not saying that the Ds did it I am saying that the Ds explicitly claimed that the causes of the meltdown were their goal and also claimed that their use of the CRA was the way they set up a housing boom. When you plead guilty before a crime is committed the cops or in this case the voters or going to operate on the that your confession of intent is valid once the crime occurs.

Its so easy to refute that BIG LIE that one wonders why the Banksters' apologists even tried to blame this law for the RE meltdown.

That law was in place for nearly 40 years before the RE meltdown.

It had absolutely nothing to do with the NINJA loans that the banksters decided to give to people who ought not have gotten mortgages.

The decision to allow NINJA loans to be given was ENTIRELY the decision of the lenders.

Countrywide was committing mortgage fraud, routinely altering documents so that they could loan people money.

<quote>
41. Former Countrywide employees have admitted that Countrywide originated loans that did not meet its underwriting criteria. Countrywide employees were incentivized to increase the number of loan originations without concern for whether the borrowers were able to repay the loans. Instead of evaluating a borrower's ability to repay the Countrywide's Sales Training Facilitator Guide instructed originators to "look for ways to make the loan rather than turn it down." According to a former Countrywide manager, "[i]f you had a pulse [Countrywide] gave you a loan."

42. Countrywide's loan originators systemically manipulated the income, assets and employment status of borrowers to qualify them for mortgages they could not afford. Countrywide loan officers would "coach" borrowers as to what level of inflated income they should state to qualify for a loan they could otherwise not afford. Countrywide also inflated borrowers' stated incomes, or facilitated income inflation, by encouraging ineligible borrowers to resort to "stated income loans." According to a former account manager, the company was "infested" with employees that ignored company underwriting standards requiring them to determine if borrowers could repay their loans.

43. Former Countrywide employees have revealed that as many as 80% of the loans originated from a Countrywide office in Florida... did not meet loan underwriting guidelines. According to another former Countrywide employee, approximately 90% of all reduced documentation ["Liar's Loans"] sold out of a Chicago office had inflated incomes, and one of Countrywide's mortgage brokers, One Source Mortgage Inc., routinely doubled the amount of the potential borrower's income on stated income mortgage applications so that borrowers could qualify for loans they could not afford.

44. Moreover, even in the few cases when Countrywide employees actually obtained income documentation (i.e. a Form W-2) demonstrating that the borrower did not qualify for a loan, the documentation was ignored by Countrywide and the loan was re-submitted as a stated income loan with an inflated income figure so as the facilitate approval of the loan.

45. Countrywide's deliberate actions of ignoring its own loan underwriting guidelines and routinely inflating borrowers' incomes resulted in the company being charged with fraud by numerous state Attorneys General. Ultimately, Countrywide settled the charges by paying a huge sum - $8.4 billion.

This is important because without those fraudulently-represented loans by Countrywide, people would not have been able to buy homes they could not have afforded. These loans were represented as being of a higher quality than they really were, which were then bundled into securitized loan and sold to investors, who thought they were buying something else.

A lot of this went on. Fraud by lenders facilitated the Housing Bubble by channeling liquidity to people who couldn't afford the houses they were buying, funded by investors who thought they were lending to those who could afford it.

The following timeline of events is the TRUTH that caused the economic collapse.

1.Our Government passes the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 in an effort to assist low-income individuals to buy homes.

2.The CRA of 1977 simply encourages banks to make a certain amount of loans to low-income individuals. No enforcement or penalty for not being encouragedyet.

3.In the mid 1990′s the HUD department of the Government begins requiring banks to prove they are making the right number of low-income loans.

4.Banks not making the government imposed and now enforced quota are penalized.

5.The Clinton and Bush administrations with Barney Frank and Chris Dodd use the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to force banks to make loans to unqualified people in the name of making homes affordable to everyone. This guarantees votes for the politicians. They ignore the likely economic outcome of giving loans to people who cant pay them back.

6.If the banks dont make the loans to unqualified borrowers, our Government prevents banks from opening new branches, new ATMs or expanding. Every bank knows if they dont accept the invite to the Government party and start giving out loans to people that cant pay them back, SOME bank will.which will force other banks out of business as the bank willing to play this game gets to expand and take marketshare from the other banks, who are denied by our Government every application to expand.

7.Unqualified borrowers (low-income, bad credit, no down-payment) are suddenly made qualified by banks being blackmailed by our own government.

8.As these unqualified borrowers flood the market overnight buying houses, a rapid decrease in housing inventory begins inflating prices beyond normal ranges. Basic supply and demand principle.

9.Builders rush in and begin building homes but panic sets in as buyers continue to flood the market for fear of being priced out forever. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) perpetuates this fear in the media to make more money through Realtor sales commissions.........&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

36.Government (and Barney Frank-the host of the Government Party) blames Wall Street and Banks for the whole thing.

The right-wing narrative relies solely on timelines, at least from what I've seen, implying a causal relationship between the CRA and the Financial Crisis without actually offering up any empirical evidence to back up their claim. I would be more than happy to be shown such a relationship, but no one on the Right has yet done so, or at least I haven't seen it. In fact, the empirical evidence thus far refutes their argument.

The idea that the CRA was a big contributor to the housing debacle keeps popping up. Thus, I'm creating a new thread to refute this assertion.

The San Francisco Fed says that the CRA was not a primary contributor to the housing bubble.

<quote>
A pair of economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco added another piece of evidence to the case that the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act wasnt the cause, or even a major contributor, to the subprime mortgage debacle.

In a paper focused on California that was presented at a Fed conference on housing and mortgages in Washington, D.C., Elizabeth Laderman and Carolina Reid say the data should help to quell if not fully lay to rest the arguments that the CRA caused the current subprime lending boom by requiring banks to lend irresponsibly in low and moderate-income lenders. Fed governor Randall Kroszner made a similar case earlier this week.

Among the specific findings in Lending in Low- and Moderate-Income Neighborhoods in California: The Performance of CRA Lending During the Subprime Meltdown:
# Overall, lending to low and moderate income communities comprised only a small share of toal lending by CRA lenders, even during the height of the California subprime lending boom.
# Loans originated by lenders regulated under CRA in general were significantly less likely to be in foreclosure than those originated by independent mortgage companies that werent covered by CRA.
# Loans made by CRA lenders within their geographic assessment areas covered by the law were half as likely to go into foreclosure as those made by the independent mortgage companies.
# 28% of loans made by CRA lenders in low income areas within their geographic assessment areas were fixed-rate loans, compared with 18.2% of loans made by independent mortgage companies in low income areas.
# 12% of the loans made by CRA lenders in these areas were high-priced loans, a technical definition of subprime, compared with 29% of the loans made by those lenders outside their assessment areas and 52.4% of loans made by independent mortgage companies in low-income areas.
</quote>
<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/12/04/dont-blame-cra-the-sequel/">Real Time Economics : Don't Blame CRA (The Sequel)</a>

Federal Reserve governor, Randall Kroszner, says the CRA had little effect on home prices.

<quote>
The striking result, Kroszner said: Only 6% of all the higher-priced loans were extended by CRA-covered lenders to lower-income borrowers or neighborhoods in their CRA assessment areas, the local geographies that are the primary focus for CRA evaluation purposes.

This result undermines the assertion by critics of the potential for a substantial role for the CRA in the subprime crisis. In other words, the very small share of all higher-priced loan originations that can reasonably be attributed to the CRA makes it hard to imagine how this law could have contributed in any meaningful way to the current subprime crisis. Banks can also meet CRA obligations by buying loans from mortgage brokers, he noted.

Again, if this were true, you should easily be able to find empirical evidence for your argument. But I haven't seen any. All that I've seen are timelines like the one you've posted which do not demonstrate any causal link.

If the CRA caused the financial crisis, then you would, at a minimum, expect CRA loans to have a greater rate of default, which did not happen. You would have also expected that home prices would have risen faster and collapsed harder in CRA areas. But again, that did not happen. 24 of the 25 largest subprime lenders were not covered by the CRA. 94% of all subprime loans were made outside of CRA areas. Yet we are supposed to believe that the CRA caused the financial crisis.

You know perfectly well that faith based anti-government believers will clutch at ANY STRAW to obfuscate the truth when the TRUTH is that the private sector screws up.

The truth is that no law of the land FORCED private banks and mortgage companies to lend money to people who couldn't afford to pay it back.

NO LAW made them do that. GREED made them do that, folks.

Fannie Mae and other banks that were bundling junk mortgages and selling them to unsuspecting investors? Now made it possible for the PRIVATE SECTOR banks NOT TO CARE if the people couldn't pay it back, of course.

You haven't established a relationship between the events. You have to back it up with data. I could write a timeline of Reagan's election and the Housing Bubble and say that he caused it, but that doesn't make it true.

If your argument is true, there should be data out there substantiating it. But I haven't seen any. I know of no conservative who has made this argument and backed it up with any data to support it. I have seen plenty of data refuting it but none that supports it.

Ten Important Things to Know About the CRA
1. The purpose of the CRA is to fight redlining and to increase bank lending in LMI neighborhoods.
Congress had two goals in mind when it passed the CRA in 1977.5 First, it saw the CRA as a way to fight bank redlining,or the outright refusal to lend in LMI, inner city, older, and predominantly minority neighborhoods. Second, it hoped that the CRA would result in more bank lending in such neighborhoods. As such, in order to comply with the CRA, it is not enough for a bank simply not to redline LMI neighborhoods. Instead, a bank must actually do something to meet the credit needs of LMI neighborhoods.
2. The CRA covers all banks whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
This includes foreign-owned banks, wholesale banks that do not have branches, internet banks, and other banks with a narrow purpose or limited business, as long as their deposits are insured by the FDIC. It

Most of the subprime lending was done by the unscrupulous mortgage companies like New Century Financial, Countrywide, First Franklin, and Long Beach Mortgage (those are in fact the top 4). None of those was covered by the CRA, because CRA only regulated "depositories", or banks in other words, and the biggest offenders were "mortgage only" lenders who sold the mortgages to the big Wall St. banks who then securitized them.

Since the biggest lenders were not regulated by CRA, CRA was not the primary driver in the mortgage crisis, unless you have some proof you wish to submit.

Also, subprime lending did not grow at any regular pace, rather, it exploded in 2004, 2005, and 2006.

<quote>
The value of USA subprime mortgages was estimated at $1.3 trillion as of March 2007, with over 7.5 million first-lien subprime mortgages outstanding. Between 2004-2006 the share of subprime mortgages relative to total originations ranged from 18%-21%, versus less than 10% in 2001-2003 and during 2007.

<a href="http://www.stat.unc.edu/faculty/cji/fys/2010/subprime-mortgage.pdf">http://www.stat.unc.edu/faculty/cji/...e-mortgage.pdf</a>

A radical change in subprime lending occurred in 2003 that caused the percentage of subprime lending to explode in 2004-2006, and that was NOT CRA. But the SEC did relax the Net Capital rule in 2003, allowing the biggest investment banks to expand their leverage ratio, which allowed them to consume the subprime debt, and without that, there would not have been anyone to buy all those bad loans.

Also Greenspan brought short term interest rates to 1% in 2003, which facilitated the LOW 2 year teaser rates that let many poor people try to buy a house, that never should have been given a loan.

SEC relaxation of the net capital rule and Greenspan dropping short term rates too low in 2003-2004 (in the effort to get Bush re-elected, the repubs sacrificed the health of the economy) was a much bigger problem than CRA.

Congress had two goals in mind when it passed the CRA in 1977.5 First, it saw the CRA as a way to fight bank redlining,or the outright refusal to lend in LMI, inner city, older, and predominantly minority neighborhoods. Second, it hoped that the CRA would result in more bank lending in such neighborhoods. As such, in order to comply with the CRA, it is not enough for a bank simply not to redline LMI neighborhoods. Instead, a bank must actually do something to meet the credit needs of LMI neighborhoods.
2. The CRA covers all banks whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
This includes foreign-owned banks, wholesale banks that do not have branches, internet banks, and other banks with a narrow purpose or limited business, as long as their deposits are insured by the FDIC. It

I read the thread, and your post on page 7, your timeline is wrong. You assert that the banks were coerced by CRA to make loans they should not have made, but the banks were not the problem in this, the big problem was the fraudulent mortgage companies, and they were not under the CRA, because the CRA only pertained to "depositories", which is why your post is wrong.

You can't prove that CRA forced Countrywide to make loans that could not be repaid, because it DID NOT!

That is why your argument is wrong.

But that's wrong.

- 94% of the subprime loans made were outside the CRA areas
- 24 of the 25 top subprime lenders did not have CRA mandates.
- the rate of default for CRA loans was no greater than other subprime mortgages
- the GSEs lost share to private lenders with no CRA mandate in subprime from 2002 through 2006, the duration of the bubble.

Therefore, you claim isn't true because most of the bad loans made had no relationship with the CRA.

The federal banking agencies enforce the CRA by examining the CRA record of a bank, issuing a written report with a rating, and taking the banks CRA record into account when considering the banks application to expand its business.
As part of their regulatory function, the federal banking agencies periodically send examiners to a bank to determine whether it is in compliance with the banking laws, including the CRA. At the end of the CRA examination, the agency issues a written report describing its findings and containing one of four ratings: outstanding record of meeting community credit needs; satisfactory record; needs to improve; and substantial non-compliance. In addition to these periodic examinations, the federal banking agencies also evaluate certain bank expansion applications to ensure that the bank is capable of expanding and qualified to do so. One of the issues the agencies consider when a bank applies to expand its business is the banks CRA record. An agency may deny an application if a bank has a poor CRA record or condition approval on improved performance.

9. The CRA enforcement process is accessible to community advocates.
Members of the public are able to participate in the CRA enforcement process. Each of the federal banking agencies publishes a quarterly list of banks it is examining for CRA compliance and invites public input. When a bank files an expansion application covered by the CRA, the bank must file a newspaper notice of the application giving members of the public a chance to file written comments. Although the CRA enforcement process is legal in nature, formal legal training is not necessary to participate in the process.

3. Performance Tests and Evaluative Standards
The CRA regulations recognize three types of banks and establish different criteria for evaluating their CRA performance.31 First, retail banks with more than $250 million in assets ("large banks") are evaluated according to the lending, investment, and service tests. Second, retail banks with $250 million or less in assets ("small banks") are subject to the small bank performance test. Third, wholesale and limited purpose banks are evaluated according to the community development test. Finally, the CRA regulations permit any bank to elect to be evaluated for CRA compliance pursuant to a strategic plan.32 The new regulations exclude certain special purpose banks entirely from CRA responsibilities.33

Really? This doesn't quite agree with you.
So what happened? Liberal politicians decided that everyone is entitled to be a homeowner. They saw people with bad credit being denied mortgages. They saw a disproportionate number of minorities being denied mortgages because a disproportionate number of minorities happen to have bad credit. They decided that bad credit is something people have little to no control over, even though poor people can have great credit if they keep their financial commitments and pay their bills on time. They concluded that the rich elite are discriminating against minorities and the poor to deny them their rights, and that something must be done.

That's why lenders have a big incentive to work with borrowers to help them stay in their homes and keep paying interest. In fact, last year there were 380,000 homeowners that lenders were fully justified in foreclosing on, but that they instead worked with so they could keep their homes. This was completely voluntary and without the government needing to intervene at all. That's the dirty little secret the democrats don't want you to know. They want you to be angry at the evil oppressive mortgage corporations cheating you out of your money and stealing your homes, so that you will vote them into office to protect and save you.

You make my point for me very well. The CRA regulated BANKS, not mortgage companies.

The biggest issuers of subprime mortgages were "mortgage companies", and Countrywide Financial and New Century Financial were the two largest subprime issuers. They were NOT regulated by CRA in any way, nor were any of the other mortgage companies.

CRA was not the primary cause of the mortgage crisis.

Back to reality.

The D HUD secretaries under Clinton signed and broadcast documents that sure read like a determination to vastly increase affordability of housing i. e. an announced intent to create a housing bubble that would eventually bust.

The means of doing this would be the CRA. IOW we the Dems say we created the means to force bubble creation and it is called CRA.

The Clinton administration climbed into the belly of the beast most noticeably Sec. of the Treasury Rubin and enticed the mortgage originators to party along with subprime, which addresses method.

Attacking a confession of intent, means, method and opportunity is hard to dismiss as blather when it all happens more or less as planned. Like the kid who sticks a knife in a wall socket the Ds were looking for stupid things and the truthful defense that they were too incompetent to pull it off just does not fly.

The historical illiteracy / revisionism on the part of the Big Government types is quite thick in this thread.

Here's a reality check:

Of course, the new federal standards couldn’t just apply to minorities. If they could pay back loans under these terms, then so could the majority of loan applicants. Quickly, in other words, these became the new standards in the industry. In 1999, the New York Times reported that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were easing credit requirements for mortgages it purchased from lenders, and as the housing market boomed, banks embraced these new standards with a vengeance. Between 2004 and 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became the biggest purchasers of subprime mortgages from all kinds of applicants, white and minority, and most of these loans were based on the lending standards promoted by the government.

Whenever a CON$ervative claims something is the "TRUTH" you can be sure it isn't!!!!!

Of course, conspicuous in its absence in your dishonest "time-line" is Bush's Dec 1993 ADDI, the actual law that made unqualified borrowers (low-income, bad credit, no down-payment) suddenly “qualified" and timed exactly with the beginning of the end of the real estate problem!!!

Bush's Dec 2003 American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) is what changed the rules to allow no downpayment loans for more than the house was worth to people with bad credit who could not keep up with the payments and who were at least 20% below the standard for the neighborhood.

Bush owns the housing crisis with his ADDI and every CON$ervative knows it!!!!!

<a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/affordablehousing/programs/home/addi/">American Dream Downpayment Initiative - Affordable Housing - CPD - HUD</a>
American Dream Downpayment Initiative
Summary

The American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) was signed into law on December 16, 2003. The American Dream Downpayment Assistance Act authorizes up to $200 million annually for fiscal years 2004 - 2007. ADDI will provide funds to all fifty states and to local participating jurisdictions that have a population of at least 150,000 or will receive an allocation of at least $50,000 under the ADDI formula. ADDI will be administered as a part of the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, a formula grant program.

Purpose

ADDI aims to increase the homeownership rate, especially among lower income and minority households, and to revitalize and stabilize communities. ADDI will help first-time homebuyers with the biggest hurdle to homeownership: downpayment and closing costs. The program was created to assist low-income first-time homebuyers in purchasing single-family homes by providing funds for downpayment, closing costs, and rehabilitation carried out in conjunction with the assisted home purchase.

Type of Assistance

ADDI will provide downpayment, closing costs, and rehabilitation assistance to eligible individuals. The amount of ADDI assistance provided may not exceed $10,000 or six percent of the purchase price of the home, whichever is greater. The rehabilitation must be completed within one year of the home purchase. Rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, the reduction of lead paint hazards and the remediation of other home health hazards.

Eligible Customers

To be eligible for ADDI assistance, individuals must be first-time homebuyers interested in purchasing single family housing. A first-time homebuyer is defined as an individual and his or her spouse who have not owned a home during the three-year period prior to the purchase of a home with ADDI assistance. ADDI funds may be used to purchase one- to four- family housing, condominium unit, cooperative unit, or manufactured housing. Additionally, individuals who qualify for ADDI assistance must have incomes not exceeding 80% of area median income.

Eligible Activities

ADDI funds may be used for downpayment, closing costs and, if necessary, rehabilitation in conjunction with home purchase. ADDI funds used for rehabilitation may not exceed twenty percent of the participating jurisdiction's total ADDI allocation. The rehabilitation assisted with ADDI funds must be completed within one year of the home purchase.

Funding Status

In FY 2007, Congress appropriated $24,750,000 for ADDI. Previously, Congress appropriated $74,513,000 in FY2003 and $86,984 in FY2004, $49,600,000 in FY2005 and $24,750,000 in FY2006. HUD has issued formula allocations for FY 2007 to assist participating jurisdictions in preparing their consolidated plans.

Obtaining Assistance

First, check the formula allocation page to determine whether your local HOME administering agency received ADDI funding. If they did not receive ADDI funding, ADDI funds may be available through your state. Every state received ADDI funds. The contacts for state are available in the HOME administering agency list.

USATODAY.com - Bush seeks to increase minority homeownership

Bush seeks to increase minority homeownership
By Thomas A. Fogarty, USA TODAY

In a bid to boost minority homeownership, President Bush will ask Congress for authority to eliminate the down-payment requirement for Federal Housing Administration loans.

In announcing the plan Monday at a home builders show in Las Vegas, Federal Housing Commissioner John Weicher called the proposal the "most significant FHA initiative in more than a decade." It would lead to 150,000 first-time owners annually, he said.

Nothing-down options are available on the private mortgage market, but, in general, they require the borrower to have pristine credit. Bush's proposed change would extend the nothing-down option to borrowers with blemished credit.

The FHA isn't a direct lender, but guarantees loan payments for mortgages on moderately priced owner-occupied property. The FHA guarantee now permits private lenders to finance as much as 97% of the purchase price of a home for millions of low- and middle-income borrowers.

In the proposal soon to be delivered to Congress, Bush would allow the FHA to guarantee loans for the full purchase price of the home, plus down-payment costs. As a practical matter, the FHA would guarantee mortgages as high as 103% of the value of the underlying property.

Here's a reality check:

of course, the new federal standards couldnt just apply to minorities. If they could pay back loans under these terms, then so could the majority of loan applicants.

Barney Frank had as much power in the house in 2001 - 2006 as Michelle Backman or Eric Cantor or Boehner did in 2006 - 2008, which is to say, none. The house passed a bill in 2005 to regulate F &amp; F by an overwhelming majority of BOTH parties, so no, BF did not have much power then, it is a right wing myth so they can try to impotently deny accountability for their failure to govern while they had the majorities in the house, senate, and the white house was all repub.

Unless you can show me a bill Frank got passed or what he ACTUALLY DID that demonstrated exercise of his "influence" other than talking that went nowhere (like the out of power repubs in 06-08, they did nothing but talk meaningless talk).

So, the fact that the repubs lost the congress in 2006 has NO bearing on the fact that the repubs were in charge of HUD in 2006, 2007, and 2008, because the HUD secretary was appointed by president Bush, and president Bush was still the president until Jan, 2009.

Alphonso Roy Jackson (born September 9, 1945) served as the 13th United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). He was nominated by President George W.

The House voted 331-90 to establish a new agency to regulate the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been accused of poor financial management in recent years. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are privately owned, congressionally chartered financial institutions created to support federal policies to assure ready availability of financing for housing.

What's your point. The bill passed with a majority of both repubs and dems voting FOR reform. Frank was irrelevant, yet the repubs want to try and dodge their accountability as the governing party in the house, the senate, and the white house and try to blame Frank, while he clearly HAD NO POWER. His own party did not vote with him on HR 1461.

So, why didn't the republican controlled senate pass a bill, S 190, and why didn't congress regulate Fannie and Freddie in 2005?

What's your point. The bill passed with a majority of both repubs and dems voting FOR reform. Frank was irrelevant, yet the repubs want to try and dodge their accountability as the governing party in the house, the senate, and the white house and try to blame Frank, while he clearly HAD NO POWER. His own party did not vote with him on HR 1461.

So, why didn't the senate pass a bill, S 190, and why didn't congress regulate Fannie and Freddie in 2005?

Freddie Mac arranged stealth lobbying in 2005

Associated Press,Oct. 19, 2008

WASHINGTON — Freddie Mac secretly paid a Republican consulting firm $2 million to kill legislation that would have regulated and trimmed the mortgage finance giant and its sister company, Fannie Mae, three years before the government took control to prevent their collapse.

In the cross hairs of the campaign carried out by DCI of Washington were Republican senators and a regulatory overhaul bill sponsored by Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. DCI's chief executive is Doug Goodyear, whom John McCain's campaign later hired to manage the GOP convention in September.

Freddie Mac's payments to DCI began shortly after the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee sent Hagel's bill to the then GOP-run Senate on July 28, 2005. All GOP members of the committee supported it; all Democrats opposed it.

In the midst of DCI's yearlong effort, Hagel and 25 other Republican senators pleaded unsuccessfully with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., to allow a vote.

"If effective regulatory reform legislation... is not enacted this year, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system and the economy as a whole," the senators wrote in a letter that proved prescient.

Unknown to the senators, DCI was undermining support for the bill in a campaign targeting 17 Republican senators in 13 states, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. The states and the senators targeted changed over time, but always stayed on the Republican side.

In the end, there was not enough Republican support for Hagel's bill to warrant bringing it up for a vote because Democrats also opposed it and the votes of some would be needed for passage. The measure died at the end of the 109th Congress.

The Republican senators targeted by DCI began hearing from prominent constituents and financial contributors, all urging the defeat of Hagel's bill because it might harm the housing boom. The effort generated newspaper articles and radio and TV appearances by participants who spoke out against the measure.

Inside Freddie Mac headquarters in 2005, the few dozen people who knew what DCI was doing referred to the initiative as "the stealth lobbying campaign," according to three people familiar with the drive.
They spoke only on condition of anonymity, saying they fear retaliation if their names were disclosed.

Freddie Mac executive Hollis McLoughlin oversaw DCI's drive, according to the three people.

"Hollis's goal was not to have any Freddie Mac fingerprints on this project and DCI became the hidden hand behind the effort," one of the three people told the AP.

Before 2004, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were Democratic strongholds. After 2004, Republicans ran their political operations. McLoughlin, who joined Freddie Mac in 2004 as chief of staff, has given $32,250 to Republican candidates over the years, including $2,800 to McCain, and has given none to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics.
On Friday night, Hagel's chief of staff, Mike Buttry, said Hagel's legislation "was the last best chance to bring greater oversight and tighter regulation to Freddie and Fannie, and they used every means they could to defeat Sen. Hagel's legislation every step of the way."

" It is outrageous that a congressionally chartered government-sponsored enterprise would lobby against a member of Congress's bill that would strengthen the regulation and oversight of that institution, " Buttry said in a statement. "America has paid an extremely high price for the reckless, and possibly criminal, actions of the leadership at Freddie and Fannie."
Nine of the 17 targeted Republican senators did not sign Hagel's letter: Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Christopher "Kit" Bond and Jim Talent of Missouri, Conrad Burns of Montana, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Olympia Snowe of Maine, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and George Allen of Virginia. Aside from the nine, 20 other Republican senators did not sign Hagel's letter.

Bill Frist (R-Tenn) did not bring the bill up for a vote because there was not adequate repub support to regulate Fannie, and since they were in the majority in the senate, that ended the effort. It turns out you don't have to buy the whole senate, you just have to get enough votes on the margin to deny the majority their majority, and DCI did that. But you will notice this did not come to light until 2008. For the republicans, you can be for regulation and against regulation at the same time.

Heck, by my count, that's 25 repubs in the senate in favor of reform, and 29 against, out of a total of 54 repub senators. The repubs couldn't even get a majority in their own caucus. This was not on Barney Frank, this could never have passed the senate because the republicans would have killed it if it came to a vote. Frist was just too smart to show the public the real story. Then you can talk about reform and blame its failure on someone else, since the hypocrits weren't on the record.

I think the interesting research will come from determining how many banks subject to CRA controls packaged and sold them as MBS.

There is an article from 1998 that points out $744 million in CRA loans that were securitized and sold as MBS.

I can't put links in my post here yet, so you will have to go to allbusiness.com and search for Packaging CRA Loans into Securities.

From the article:

"Both the First Union ($416 million) securitization in November 1997 and the Mellon deal ($328 million) in April 1998 were several times oversubscribed. What is even more interesting is who bought the loans. Was it banks seeking CRA investment credit? No, it wasn't. The overwhelming participants were money managers and insurance companies buying the loans strictly because of their investment appeal."

I've also been reading that CRA loans are less profitable, or not profitable, when compared to non-CRA loans. This would be more incentivization for banks to securitize them and sell them to the likes of Goldman-Sachs.

Ironically, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System website, their official website, has a page dedicated to a survey of banks to show evidence of the profitability or loss of their CRA loans....and so far, all of the links are broken.

If someone finds where those documents are, please let me know as that would show that banks losing money on CRA loans would bend over backwards to sell them.

Obviously, for the past 30 years banks did not make any more CRA loans than they could afford to and not go out of business. No bank would do that, and since all banks had the same restraint, namely making a profit, there were only so many CRA loans they any one bank could make so the playing field was even.

What is important to find out, is how many CRA loans were securitized and either sold to Wall Street or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If WS or the Government became insatiable buyers of these loans, (which I believe is likely since the government was incensed on making homes "affordable") then it would make sense for banks to make as many of these CRA loans as possible and sell them away as quickly as possible and just enjoy the fee revenue.

At the end of the day, the mortgage crisis was caused by many things, and if securitization of CRA loans (especially if they were not profitable or low-profit) proliferated after that oversubscribed offer of $744 million then the CRA was definitely a part of it.

Yet in 2007 if it was already known by both parties they needed to fix Freddy and Fanny the democrats could have done so but did not.
2007

July: Two Bear Stearns hedge funds invested in mortgage securities collapse.

August: President Bush emphatically calls on Congress to pass a reform package for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying “first things first when it comes to those two institutions. Congress needs to get them reformed, get them streamlined, get them focused, and then I will consider other options.” (President George W. Bush, Press Conference, The White House, 8/9/07).

September: RealtyTrac announces foreclosure filings up 243,000 in August – up 115 percent from the year before.

September: Single-family existing home sales decreases 7.5 percent from the previous month – the lowest level in nine years. Median sale price of existing homes fell six percent from the year before.

December: President Bush again warns Congress of the need to pass legislation reforming GSEs, saying “These institutions provide liquidity in the mortgage market that benefits millions of homeowners, and it is vital they operate safely and operate soundly. So I’ve called on Congress to pass legislation that strengthens independent regulation of the GSEs – and ensures they focus on their important housing mission. The GSE reform bill passed by the House earlier this year is a good start. But the Senate has not acted. And the United States Senate needs to pass this legislation soon.” (President George W. Bush, Discusses Housing, The White House, 12/6/07).

You news sourse got a new article written about itself

Pete Yost’s story: How a Democratic reporter covers Freddie Mac
If you’re a Democratic news reporter covering Freddie Mac, the mortgage lender that the Democrats for 15 years used as multibillion-dollar slush fund for poor home buyers who had no way to pay back their loans, the logical path is to steer the story away from the central culprits.

Pete Yost of the Associated Press accomplished the cover-up with his story yesterday.

This was not on Barney Frank, this could never have passed the senate because the republicans would have killed it if it came to a vote. Frist was just too smart to show the public the real story. Then you can talk about reform and blame its failure on someone else, since the hypocrits weren't on the record.

July: Two Bear Stearns hedge funds invested in mortgage securities collapse.

August: President Bush emphatically calls on Congress to pass a reform package for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying first things first when it comes to those two institutions. Congress needs to get them reformed, get them streamlined, get them focused, and then I will consider other options. (President George W. Bush, Press Conference, The White House, 8/9/07).

September: RealtyTrac announces foreclosure filings up 243,000 in August  up 115 percent from the year before.

September: Single-family existing home sales decreases 7.5 percent from the previous month  the lowest level in nine years. Median sale price of existing homes fell six percent from the year before.

December: President Bush again warns Congress of the need to pass legislation reforming GSEs, saying These institutions provide liquidity in the mortgage market that benefits millions of homeowners, and it is vital they operate safely and operate soundly. So Ive called on Congress to pass legislation that strengthens independent regulation of the GSEs  and ensures they focus on their important housing mission. The GSE reform bill passed by the House earlier this year is a good start. But the Senate has not acted. And the United States Senate needs to pass this legislation soon. (President George W.

Pete Yosts story: How a Democratic reporter covers Freddie Mac
If youre a Democratic news reporter covering Freddie Mac, the mortgage lender that the Democrats for 15 years used as multibillion-dollar slush fund for poor home buyers who had no way to pay back their loans, the logical path is to steer the story away from the central culprits.

Pete Yost of the Associated Press accomplished the cover-up with his story yesterday.

Posted Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2000

Associated Press reporter Pete Yost played by the journalistic rules last Thursday when he granted anonymity to the sources who provided him with his big scoop: that Independent Counsel Robert Ray had impaneled a new grand jury to hear evidence against President Clinton. As Yost chased his own story on Thursday and Friday, publishing the peeved speculations of big-name Democrats that the sources were Republicans, he continued to follow the official rulebook. He kept a poker face, reported the facts, and protected his sources. But playing by the rules, in this instance, meant behaving unethically.

The sleazy thing about reporting the Democrats' speculations was that Yost knew that the speculations were basically wrong. As it turned out, one of Yost's sources was not a vengeful Republican but a Democrat on the federal bench.

Yost's scoop, which hit the wires at 3:29 p.m. ET on Thursday, made the Democrats mad as red ants. With Vice President Al Gore just hours from giving his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Democrats insisted that Republican leakers, determined to embarrass Gore on his big night, were behind Yost's story.

And again in a separate matter, the dems accuse Yost of supporting republican lies about the dems:

<quote>
February 18, 2006

The Republicans have been caught red-handed in Abramoffgate. So what is their defense? To say Democrats took Abramoff money too.

Of course that is just another REPUBLICAN BIG LIE. Abramoff was a hard-core Republican and never gave a single penny to a Democrat in his life.

Howard Dean smacked down the REPUBLICAN BIG LIE on Wolf Blitzer's show on 1/9/06.

"There are no Democrats who took money from Jack Abramoff, not one, not one single Democrat. Every person named in this scandal is a Republican. Every person under investigation is a Republican. Every person indicted is a Republican. This is a Republican finance scandal. There is no evidence that Jack Abramoff ever gave any Democrat any money. And we've looked through all of those FEC reports to make sure that's true."

But Republicans cannot stop lying. On Friday, GOP spokesliar Tracey Schmitt told Pete Yost of the AP: "Considering 28 of the 31 Democrats have received Abramoff-affiliated funds themselves, it appears their hypocrisy has exceeded even their partisanship. "

What the hell are "Abramoff-affiliated funds"? If Abramoff called Pizza Hut in DC and a Pizza Hut delivery man in California gave $1 to Barbara Boxer, is that an "Abramoff-affiliated fund"?

This is utter bullshit, and it is utter bullshit that Pete Yost included this in his article. Let's demand a retraction and an apology: <a href="mailto:pyost@ap.org">pyost@ap.org</a>

Now, if you can piss off the repubs and the dems, Mr. Yost looks like a pretty balanced reporter to me, certainly more creditable than your lonely blogger, and remember, you never (nor did your lone blogger) even attempted to dispute one single fact that was reported. What good does it possibly do to attempt to tarnish a source, if you ACCEPT all his facts? Fail.

Now, re Pres Bush and the dems passage of Fannie and Freddie reform, post the dems winning the congress in 2006:

<quote>
- January 2007 - Democrats take control of the House and Senate; Barney Frank is named Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
- March 28, 2007 - The House Financial Services Committee passes H.R. 1427, the GSE reform bill, by a vote of 49-15. The legislation had the support of the Bush Administration and represented a tougher bill than the 2005 effort. Incredibly, 19 Republicans opposed the bill.
- May 22, 2007 - The House of Representatives passes H.R. 1427, by a vote of 313-104. All opposition came from Republicans.
- January, 2008 - Chairman Frank offers to insert both GSE reform and FHA reform into the stimulus bill that was being negotiated by Democrats and Republicans in Congress and the Bush Administration. Secretary Paulson declined, citing opposition from the White House.
- May 8, 2008 - House of Representatives passes H.R. 3221, which contains GSE reform provision, after receiving the Senate amendments to the original bill.
- May 20, 2008 - The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee passes a bill containing GSE Reform provisions- The Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008.
- July 11, 2008 - The United States Senate passes GSE reform as part of a bigger bill.
- July 30, 2008 - President Bush signs GSE reform as part of H.R. 3221

So, the dem congress did pass Fannie and Freddie reform and President Bush signed the bill. Of course by that time, July 2008, the financial crisis was about to explode in Sept 2008 with the failure of Lehman Bros. and the fire sale acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch. The last opportunity to do something to avert the disaster that occurred on the republican watch (and it grew up on the repub watch also, especially in 2004-2006), was S 190 in the senate, and while many repubs talked about the problem, the problem was well known, THEY DID NOTHING TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM FROM GETTING WORSE! When we needed the repubs in the senate (who had the majority at the time in 2005) to ACT, with a bill passed by all repubs in committee, Bill Frist never brought it to the senate floor for a vote because he could not even get a majority of his republican caucus to vote for the bill. The repubs had that mantle to govern, and they allowed a bubble in housing coupled with lack of banking and mortgage regulations to create the biggest financial crisis in the US since the great depression. The republicans failed to govern effectively from 2001 to 2006. And you have failed to show anything to dispute that this assessment is true.

Now I'm going to show you how the republicans fixed it so Fannie and Freddie could not be regulated, when regulation was needed.

<a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/6067545.html">Freddie Mac arranged stealth lobbying in 2005 | Business | Chron.com - Houston Chronicle</a>

Bill Frist (R-Tenn) did not bring the bill up for a vote because there was not adequate repub support to regulate Fannie, and since they were in the majority in the senate, that ended the effort. It turns out you don't have to buy the whole senate, you just have to get enough votes on the margin to deny the majority their majority, and DCI did that.

I see you don't dispute even one fact in the AP story about how the repubs sold themselves out in the senate and failed to pass some of the most needed legislation of our time. You question my source based on an anonymous internet blogger with zero credentials. I googled him and came up with nothing except his little personal blog. He's a nobody.

Can I ask a simple question?

Suspending the discussion of the CRA's role in the housing bubble for a minute...I'd like to ask the supporters of the CRA to explain why they support it at all?

You're spending a lot of time defending it, so I'd like to know why.

The only entities that take part in unprofitable ventures are the government and bankrupt companies. If making CRA loans were profitable, then banks would already have done them. In fact I would not discount the very likely possibility that CRA loans fail at a rate higher than non-CRA loans. They don't have to fail much more, only enough more to make them unattractive to participate in.

Whether the costs associated with CRA's are due to defaulted loans or simply higher servicing costs, it would seem clear that they are not profitable or banks would already be in the business of providing them pre-government mandate.

If we believe CRA loans are unprofitable for banks, then the costs of providing them are socialized among the bank's other customers through higher fees and/or interest rates or higher hurdles to qualify for a loan.

It takes a law created by social engineers (read politicians) to force a private company to do something unprofitable. So with that in mind, and suspension of the current thread for a moment why do the supporters of the CRA on this thread support the CRA (or its concept) at all?

Why do supporters of the CRA believe that the associated higher servicing costs should be distributed to other citizens?

Hi Toro:

<quote orig_author="Toro">
The idea that the CRA was a big contributor to the housing debacle keeps popping up. Thus, I'm creating a new thread to refute this assertion.
</quote>
Trying to blame the Community Reinvestment Act or sub-prime loans or anything to do with banks for the current Foreclosure/Bankruptcy/Housing Crisis is effort thrown after complete and utter foolishness!!!! The reason your home price value will continue to go DOWN into the toilet is for reasons that have nothing to do with banks and everything to do with corrupt US Federal, State and Local politicians bowing to corporate elites that are destroying America very much on purpose. The primary reason for the current housing crisis is summed up in two words:

1. <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/disp.nr0.htm">Worker Displacement</a>. <a href="http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;q=worker%20displacement%20&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=worker+displacement+definition&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=87581eb4c8da6568&amp;pf=p&amp;pdl=300">Google</a> the phrase and educate yourself.

The corrupt politicians are responsible for displacing as many U.S. workers as possible from the local job markets by:

A. <a href="http://www.rense.com/general76/cclle.htm">NAFTA</a> offshoring of the manufacturing base. Thank Robert Reich ( <a href="http://www.examiner.com/conservative-in-san-francisco/robert-reich-the-man-behind-implementations-of-jobs-killing-nafta?render=print">story</a> ).

B. <a href="http://www12.georgetown.edu/sfs/isim/Event%20Summaries&amp;Speeches/Overview%20of%20the%20Congressional%20Debate%20on%20Guest%20Worker.pdf">23 HB-1 Visa-style Guest Worker Programs</a> that import 1.5 million foreign nationals into the USA every year 'legally.'

C. <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Jobs-in-America---Outsourcing-is-Killing-the-Opportunities&amp;id=4651200">Outsourcing of jobs</a> overseas and south of the border.

D. <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/7801">20 million goddamned illegal aliens</a> making up the Clinton/Bush/Obama Cheap Illegal Alien Labor Pool that allows U.S. employers to pick around U.S. workers in favor of hiring foreign nationals from all over the world for pennies on the dollar.

Bush and Obama are throwing money at their Wall Street Bankster pals, while masons and carpenters and tile setters and dry-wall people and painters and everyone working with their hands are being systematically displaced out of the job markets by cheap illegal aliens willing to do the job for less than half the price and nobody is doing one thing to enforce the perfectly good immigration, employment and document fraud laws already on the books. The idiot border patrol people sit out there staring across the border, while 20 million goddamned illegal aliens run around loose EVERYWHERE stealing identities and jobs from U.S. Citizens 'and' kill 25 U.S. Citizens every day ( <a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53103">12 by murder</a> ).

The reason the value of your house will continue going down has nothing to do with Community Reinvestment or any such NONSENSE, which is only a smokescreen topic to keep you looking in the wrong direction. Fewer and fewer Americans can afford to make their own house payments, because of 'Worker Displacement,' which means more foreclosures and bankruptcies and more distressed houses on the market in direct competition with your house. Period. Your house is only worth what real Americans are willing to pay at any given time and that number will continue to go DOWN into the ground, until somebody starts looking out for U.S. workers. That is never going to happen, because the corrupt politicians are destroying America very much on purpose, so the House of Rothschild/Rockefeller can bring in their New World Order and make subjects of everyone in the Fascist State of CanAmeriMexico.

That is what Americans deserve for being so stupid...

GL,

Terral

Thanks for the support. I was reading this entire thread and saw so much heavy lifting by those defending the CRA involvement in the housing bubble I wanted to jump in and say something in their defense.

Obviously the CRA did not cause the housing bubble all by itself, but nobody can prove that it didn't contribute to it. For all the times CRA supporters demand empirical evidence that it played a part, they never seem to provide empirical evidence that it didn't.

Which means the burden falls on the concept of the CRA itself. If they are defending it at all for any reason, then they must support the idea of a CRA in general and that is really the core of this problem.

The CRA is a bad idea for the reasons I stated in my previous comments. So regardless of the percentage of involvement it played in the housing bubble, be it 0.9% or 99% or somewhere in between, it was a bad idea and CRA supporters, to use their own words, 'must prove with empirical evidence' that it was, and is, a good idea and why.

Otherwise, can we all agree to just abolish it? Can the CRA supporters, regardless of its involvement in the housing bubble, at least agree that we should eliminate the CRA?

Yes? No? Your people will call my people?

Well the major problem with CRA and other forms of economic stimulus (which CRA was designed to be for poor neighborhoods) is that it distorts investment decisions. In simple terms the goal of CRA was to avoid gentrification or other changes that might break up the culture of poverty but instead to discourage movement out of the ghetto or barrio. The CRA specified investment in areas that were redlined for good actuarial reasons as in why rent in Watts when you can buy there? Well first off do you want your kids growing up in that kind of dysfunctional community?

You did great with your question. As far as the repeal of the CRA I doubt it will happen to many hands are in the money pot for that to happen. Plus the ACLU, with the support of the NAACP would sue to prevent it from happening. Not saying that a law suit would stop congressional legislation but it would raise a big stink.

I'm not a supporter of the CRA and I am not defending it. I have no opinion about the CRA as policy. What I am dispelling is that it caused or was even a factor in the Housing Bubble.

The only people I ever see make this argument are highly partisan individuals who have a vested interest in promoting an ideological or political agenda. I once read a bank CEO complain about having to make uneconomic loans because of the CRA, but that doesn't explain perhaps the biggest asset bubble in history.

Well, there's also no proof that the New England Patriots didn't cause the Housing Bubble too, but we can safely say they didn't. You can't prove a negative, after all.

But in fact, we can safely conclude the CRA didn't play any meaningful part in the debacle since we can look at the outcomes of the Housing Bubble.

If one believes in the efficacy of markets - and most on the Right do - then one would have expected that CRA-loans would have had a disproportionate affect on housing prices. A disproportionate amount of credit would have been funneled to CRA areas, which would have lead to an excess of buying and skyrocketing prices, leading to a collapse and massive defaults.

But did that happen? No, of course not. The poor areas were not the markets which saw the biggest increases in price. In fact, it was just the opposite. Also, one would have expected the biggest subsequent home price collapses to have occurred in CRA areas, but again, this is not what occurred.

One would have also expected to have seen a higher rate of default on CRA loans. But again that did not happen.

It also defies belief when one of the biggest 25 subprime lenders were subject to CRA loans. This is like saying that one small, Midwest brokerage was responsible for the Tech Bubble while all the others had nothing to do with it. C'mon, that's not a serious argument.

People who make the CRA argument not only have no idea what actually happened in the market, they don't know history. In fact, what happened in the Financial Crisis is normally what happens in real estate bubbles. The people who drove it were generally middle and upper middle class people buying into the Sun Belt. For the last 100 years, there have been periodic booms and busts in real estate in this country, and they all look pretty similar. Generally, the places that have gone up the most then fell the most were Southern California, Florida and Arizona. Las Vegas, which is a relatively new city and hasn't seen as many wild swings, got into the act as well. Texas mostly skipped the boom and bust because it is still hung over from the 80s bust and the oil economy has done well. This is no different.

The other glaring omission is that this boom and bust was global. Other countries which saw massive real estate bubbles were Ireland, the UK, Holland, Portugal, Spain, Singapore, Australia, Canada, China, Norway and South Africa, to name a few. Some countries, such as Canada, Norway, Australia and China, are still in the bubble. This is the first time in history when a real estate bubble was global. How did the CRA cause a housing bubble in Norway and Portugal?

This is a political argument completely without merit.

That doesn't mean the government is absolved of all blame. Far from it. In fact, I think the government was the primary cause of the Housing Bubble, primarily through the Federal Reserve, which kept interest rates too low. If you know financial history and understand the commonalities of all these bubbles, you understand that the Fed is one of the primary culprits. Bubbles only occur with excess credit creation. It is they who are most responsible for influencing credit creation in this country, and it is they who de-regulated and resisted regulation of much of the financial industry, which created all sorts of products which channeled credit into the asset markets, meaning Wall Street shares in a great deal of the culpability. Others have made the argument that excess savings in China were responsible, and that may be true to some extent, but I think it had far less responsibility than the Fed.

The only people I ever see make this argument are highly partisan individuals who have a vested interest in promoting an ideological or political agenda. I once read a bank CEO complain about having to make uneconomic loans because of the CRA, but that doesn't explain perhaps the biggest asset bubble in history.

Obviously the CRA did not cause the housing bubble all by itself, but nobody can prove that it didn't contribute to it. For all the times CRA supporters demand empirical evidence that it played a part, they never seem to provide empirical evidence that it didn't.

Well, there's also no proof that the New England Patriots didn't cause the Housing Bubble too, but we can safely say they didn't. You can't prove a negative, after all.

But in fact, we can safely conclude the CRA didn't play any meaningful part in the debacle since we can look at the outcomes of the Housing Bubble.

If one believes in the efficacy of markets - and most on the Right do - then one would have expected that CRA-loans would have had a disproportionate affect on housing prices. A disproportionate amount of credit would have been funneled to CRA areas, which would have lead to an excess of buying and skyrocketing prices, leading to a collapse and massive defaults.

But did that happen? No, of course not. The poor areas were not the markets which saw the biggest increases in price. In fact, it was just the opposite. Also, one would have expected the biggest subsequent home price collapses to have occurred in CRA areas, but again, this is not what occurred.

One would have also expected to have seen a higher rate of default on CRA loans. But again that did not happen.

It also defies belief when one of the biggest 25 subprime lenders were subject to CRA loans. This is like saying that one small, Midwest brokerage was responsible for the Tech Bubble while all the others had nothing to do with it. C'mon, that's not a serious argument.

People who make the CRA argument not only have no idea what actually happened in the market, they don't know history. In fact, what happened in the Financial Crisis is normally what happens in real estate bubbles. The people who drove it were generally middle and upper middle class people buying into the Sun Belt. For the last 100 years, there have been periodic booms and busts in real estate in this country, and they all look pretty similar. Generally, the places that have gone up the most then fell the most were Southern California, Florida and Arizona. Las Vegas, which is a relatively new city and hasn't seen as many wild swings, got into the act as well. Texas mostly skipped the boom and bust because it is still hung over from the 80s bust and the oil economy has done well. This is no different.

The other glaring omission is that this boom and bust was global. Other countries which saw massive real estate bubbles were Ireland, the UK, Holland, Portugal, Spain, Singapore, Australia, Canada, China, Norway and South Africa, to name a few. Some countries, such as Canada, Norway, Australia and China, are still in the bubble. This is the first time in history when a real estate bubble was global. How did the CRA cause a housing bubble in Norway and Portugal?

This is a political argument completely without merit.

That doesn't mean the government is absolved of all blame. Far from it. In fact, I think the government was the primary cause of the Housing Bubble, primarily through the Federal Reserve, which kept interest rates too low. If you know financial history and understand the commonalities of all these bubbles, you understand that the Fed is one of the primary culprits. Bubbles only occur with excess credit creation. It is they who are most responsible for influencing credit creation in this country, and it is they who de-regulated and resisted regulation of much of the financial industry, which created all sorts of products which channeled credit into the asset markets, meaning Wall Street shares in a great deal of the culpability. Others have made the argument that excess savings in China were responsible, and that may be true to some extent, but I think it had far less responsibility than the Fed.

Three Ways The CRA Pushed Countrywide To Lower Lending Standards

1. The Creation Of Artificial Demand For Low-Income Mortgages

Some people aren't as fast contecting the dots as I am. It's the small stuff that I look at. Yost is a poklitcal hack the story is a fail. Unless you have proof from some other source supporting yost propaganda.

Your boy Warner doesn't even call him a hack, you are making stuff up. You have failed to answer my questions, who is Warner, what does he do, why does he have any credibility? You are clinging to this thread because it is what you found and you have no other thread to cling to. What is the proof warner offers that Yost is a dem? NONE. He just indicates he sort of believes it. If his reason is based on the fact that Yost is bursting his repub myth of right, I have shown 2 articles where the dems attack Yost for attacking them, so proof is on my side that Yost is objective and he criticizes BOTH PARTIES. Show me mr. warners objectivity, but I know you can't because mr. warner is an unknown. That's pathetic, its not proof.

This story was widely carried nationally, even by Fox News:
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,440681,00.html">Freddie Mac Tried to Kill Republican Regulatory Bill in 2005 - Politics | Republican Party | Democratic Party | Political Spectrum - FOXNews.com</a>

Fox is not in the habit of carrying "democrat hack jobs".

This story was WIDELY carried nationally. There are hundreds of articles on the net. There is NO REPUBLICAN REBUTTAL, NONE!

If the repubs had the votes, there were 54 repub senators at the time, and the only thing stopping this was a dem filibuster threat, they would have brought the bill to the floor for a vote, forced the dems to filibuster and put them on the record opposing regulation of fannie/freddie, and they could have really blamed some of the financial crisis on the dems. They didn't bring the bill to the floor for a vote, because they could see by the lack of signatures on Hagel's letter asking for the vote, they would have been embarrassed by the failure of repub support to regulate freddie.

1. There is NO proof that Yost is a dem or a hack.
2. Warner is a total unknown.
3. The AP story was widely reported, including of Fox News, and it has never been rebutted by anyone. That is because Yost has insider testimony and documentation in Freddie budgets.

All the credibility is on my side, and you have NONE.

Yes, both parties screwed the american people.

Clearly there were many dem idiotic statements, include those ridiculous youtube videos from barney frank and maxine waters.

Clearly fannie and freddie needed reform, appraisers failed to provide valid valuations of houses, rating agencies lied to the american people and to the world, the wall st banks packaged up garbage bonds and foisted them on the public.

But I refuse to accept this was primarily on the dems. This blew up in 2004-2006, and the repubs held majorities in both branches of congress plus the white house. they were given the mantel of leadership, and they led us into financial crisis, the worst since the great depression. The repubs would talk fannie reform, but there were enough of them that wanted the party to go on, with rich fat cat CEO's getting rich while selling garbage to the public. Those repubs failed the nation, and I won't forgive them for it. They knew what was happening and did not act to prevent it. The dems were not helpful, but they weren't the majority either.

Because I do not accept that the economic crisis was primarily on the dems does not imply that they bear no culpability. They could have done a better job recognizing the problem and speaking correctly about it from their minority position in both branches of congress. They did not do that, and they bear some blame for it. They don't bear most of the blame, because the repubs held majority in BOTH houses of congress from 1994-2006.

The explosion in subprime lending that sunk the economy occurred mainly in 2004-2006, when the percentage of subprime loans out of total loans issued rocketed up from 7% to 21% in just a couple of years, from 2002 to 2004. That is where the problem was, and that is totally on the repub watch, controlling the house, senate, and white house.

The SEC did not have to relax the net capital rule in 2003 for the 5 investment banks and allow them to extend their leverage from 15:1 to 45:1, but they did. The SEC was supposed to monitor those banks, but they didn't, which directly led to the failure of Lehman Bros, and the fire sale of Merrill and Bear Stearns.

Greenspan did not have to drive short term rates down to 1% in 2003 and 2004 (but he did in order to get Bush re-elected, at the long term expense of a sound economy). The treasury under the repubs didn't have to expand the money supply twice as fast as GDP growth during that period, but they did; it's inflationary and that is why we saw 15% annual inflation in home prices that helped lead to the crash.

Greenspan could have tightened regulations on the mortgage companies, he had the authority, but he didn't. He let them abuse their clients without lifting a finger.

I agree with you, both parties screwed the nation, the dems bear part of the responsibility, but since the repubs were the leadership party with the majorities in the house and senate from 94 - 06, and including the white house from 01-08, most of the responsibility rests with the repubs. Clinton turned over a balanced budget and a sound economy in a mild dot com bust recession. The repubs irresponsibly over stimulated the housing market while under regulating the banks and created a near economic collapse. The repubs did a poor job managing the economy from 01-06.

Because I do not accept that the economic crisis was primarily on the dems does not imply that they bear no culpability. They could have done a better job recognizing the problem and speaking correctly about it from their minority position in both branches of congress. They did not do that, and they bear some blame for it. They don't bear most of the blame, because the repubs held majority in BOTH houses of congress from 1994-2006.

The explosion in subprime lending that sunk the economy occurred mainly in 2004-2006, when the percentage of subprime loans out of total loans issued rocketed up from 7% to 21% in just a couple of years, from 2002 to 2004. That is where the problem was, and that is totally on the repub watch, controlling the house, senate, and white house.

The SEC did not have to relax the net capital rule in 2003 for the 5 investment banks and allow them to extend their leverage from 15:1 to 45:1, but they did. The SEC was supposed to monitor those banks, but they didn't, which directly led to the failure of Lehman Bros, and the fire sale of Merrill and Bear Stearns.

Greenspan did not have to drive short term rates down to 1% in 2003 and 2004 (but he did in order to get Bush re-elected, at the long term expense of a sound economy). The treasury under the repubs didn't have to expand the money supply twice as fast as GDP growth during that period, but they did; it's inflationary and that is why we saw 15% annual inflation in home prices that helped lead to the crash.

Greenspan could have tightened regulations on the mortgage companies, he had the authority, but he didn't. He let them abuse their clients without lifting a finger.

I agree with you, both parties screwed the nation, the dems bear part of the responsibility, but since the repubs were the leadership party with the majorities in the house and senate from 94 - 06, and including the white house from 01-08, most of the responsibility rests with the repubs. Clinton turned over a balanced budget and a sound economy in a mild dot com bust recession. The repubs irresponsibly over stimulated the housing market while under regulating the banks and created a near economic collapse. The repubs did a poor job managing the economy from 01-06.

BIS working paper

<quote>
Contrary to some media commentary, there is no evidence that the Community Reinvestment Act was responsible for encouraging the subprime lending boom and subsequent housing bust. This Act only applies to depositories, and did not cover most of the important subprime lenders. Depositories showed a lesser tendency to write subprime loans than lenders not subject to the Act

Subprime loans in CRA areas were made a lower rate than subprime loans outside of CRA areas.

<quote>
The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to expand mortgage lending in the communities in which they have branch offices, subject to maintaining overall levels of financial safety and soundness. Some have argued that this regulation forced banks to lower their credit standards and engage in riskier mortgage products in order to extend credit to lower-income individuals, who perhaps should not have received such loans. However, data provided by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) reveal that loans covered by the CRA accounted for only a fraction of mortgage lending to lower-income borrowers and neighborhoods. This is especially true of higher-priced, or subprime, mortgages.1 CRA assessment-area lending accounted for only nine percent of higher-priced loans to lower-income borrowers and neighborhoods, while independent mortgage companies accounted for the majority. Further, the subprime share of assessment-area loans made to lower-income borrowers and lower-income neighborhoods was lower than the subprime share for all loans made between 2004 and 2006....

In 1980, seventy-one percent of all one-to-four family home mortgages were originated by a deposit-taking bank or thrift. However, over the last several decades, innovations in capital markets enabled companies to raise capital by selling mortgage-backed securities into the secondary market. Without deposits, the CRA did not have the jurisdiction to regulate the new independent mortgage companies....

There are many causes to the collapse of the housing market and the recent financial turmoil, but the contribution of the CRA appears marginal. While banks did engage in subprime lending in their assessment areas, they did so at a lower rate than the market in general and accounted for only a small fraction of subprime loans to lower-income borrowers and lower income neighborhoods. The data suggest that far from being forced into risky corners of the market, the institutions under the scrutiny of the CRA were crowded out by unregulated lenders.

About a year ago, Paul Krugman noted that over half of all commercial real estate loans were underwater. Of course, the CRA has no jurisdiction over CRE loans.

<quote>
But reading this scary piece about commercial real estate, I realized that CRE offers yet another debunking. After all, there was no federal act driving banks to lend money for office parks and shopping malls; Fannie and Freddie weren’t in the CRE loan business; yet 55 percent — 55 percent! — of commercial mortgages that will come due before 2014 are underwater.

Most subprime loans had nothing to do with the CRA. In fact, most subprime loans were made in an area of the market that is more deregulated than the regular banking market.

<quote>
The Community Reinvestment Act, passed in 1977, requires banks to lend in the low-income neighborhoods where they take deposits. Just the idea that a lending crisis created from 2004 to 2007 was caused by a 1977 law is silly. But its even more ridiculous when you consider that most subprime loans were made by firms that arent subject to the CRA. University of Michigan law professor Michael Barr testified back in February before the House Committee on Financial Services that 50% of subprime loans were made by mortgage service companies not subject comprehensive federal supervision and another 30% were made by affiliates of banks or thrifts which are not subject to routine supervision or examinations. As former Fed Governor Ned Gramlich said in an August, 2007, speech shortly before he passed away: In the subprime market where we badly need supervision, a majority of loans are made with very little supervision. It is like a city with a murder law, but no cops on the beat.

Not surprisingly given the higher degree of supervision, loans made under the CRA program were made in a more responsible way than other subprime loans. CRA loans carried lower rates than other subprime loans and were less likely to end up securitized into the mortgage-backed securities that have caused so many losses, according to a recent study by the law firm Traiger &amp; Hinckley <a href="http://www.traigerlaw.com/publications/traiger_hinckley_llp_cra_foreclosure_study_1-7-08.pdf">(PDF file here).</a>

Finally, keep in mind that the Bush administration has been weakening CRA enforcement and the laws reach since the day it took office. The CRA was at its strongest in the 1990s, under the Clinton administration, a period when subprime loans performed quite well. It was only after the Bush administration cut back on CRA enforcement that problems arose, a timing issue which should stop those blaming the law dead in their tracks. The Federal Reserve, too, did nothing but encourage the wild west of lending in recent years. It wasnt until the middle of 2007 that the Fed decided it was time to crack down on abusive pratices in the subprime lending market. Oops.

Most analysts see the sub-prime crisis as a market failure. Believing the bubble would never pop, lenders approved risky adjustable-rate mortgages, often without considering whether borrowers could afford them; families took on those loans; investors bought them in securitized form; and, all the while, regulators sat on their hands....

It's telling that, amid all the recent recriminations, even lenders have not fingered CRA. That's because CRA didn't bring about the reckless lending at the heart of the crisis. Just as sub-prime lending was exploding, CRA was losing force and relevance. And the worst offenders, the independent mortgage companies, were never subject to CRA -- or any federal regulator. Law didn't make them lend. The profit motive did.

I believe the govt. has a role to play in ensuring that all americans have access to loans on a fair basis, which is what CRA was designed to do. It was designed to end the evil bank practice of "redlining" or refusing to loan in certain area, despite the fact that you operate a bank there and gather assets there. That would and did result in blighted areas.

The CRA attempted to correct that by saying that if you operate in an area, you have to provide loans to individuals in that area to a guidelines specified percentage. If you don't want to do that, you should sell your bank to someone who will collect assets and make loans in that area. If you don't want to sell the bank and you don't operate the bank according to the CRA guidelines, then you can't open any more banks in that state. That is what CRA did.

In later years like the 90's, a bank may have a lending standard that called for a credit score of 720 to qualify for a loan. Under that internal bank standard, maybe nobody in an area qualifies for a loan. CRA says you need to look deeper, and maybe you give a loan to a person with a credit score of 680, who has been at the same job for 10 years, maybe he skipped a couple of car payments but he caught up and paid off the car eventually. That is what CRA forced the banks to do, look a little deeper and make the loan determination the way banks used to, based on some personal knowledge of the situation. The CRA never forced a bank to make a loan to individuals who could not pay the money back.

As stated previously, the CRA regulated banks found they could conduct their business in those areas PROFITABLY.

So no, I don't see CRA as a driving force in the mortgage backed security crisis.

You're dodging...

The question the left seems unwilling to answer is whether the government should have a role in seeing to it that folks own their own home...

Why?

Here's why. The founding of this nation guaranteed no such thing. On the other hand, President Roosevelt, did.
This, from his 'Second Bill of Rights:'
The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;

The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;

The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;

The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;

The right of every family to a decent home ;

The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;

The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;

The right to a good education.

Do you see all of the guarantees inherent?
Now, where do you see the source of the revenue to pay for same?

So, if you belive the above, you do not believe that capitalism- modified capitalism, such as the system we live with today- is the best system for prosperity of the people of the United States.

Yes, that is an exageration on the poor people in the world, but you SHOULD be able to get the gist of the argument that supports Toro's stance....IF you allow yourself. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

I'm going to assume that you do...but that you would rather pretend that Freddie, Fannie, the CRA, the Clinton HUD, Barney Frank and Chris Dodd are not of the Democrat persuasion.

Can I toss ACORN in there as well?

As you well know in spite of your playing dumb, any debate on the "Housing Debacle" centers around Bush and his Dec 2003 ADDI. It was the centerpiece of his 2004 election campaign. The GOP realized that if they could strip off just a small percentage of minority votes from the Dems they could win in 2004 and the ADDi was the vehicle the GOP chose to do it with.

Since you brought up your MessiahRushie, even he admits 2004 was the turning point in the sub-prime housing market. The CRA didn't happen in 2004, but Bush's ADDI did!!!! The housing market may have been on the edge before the ADDI passed in December 2003, but it obviously was Bush's ADDI reelection ploy that changed the law and pushed the housing market over the edge from 2004 on. It was Bush's ADDI that burst the housing bubble.

RUSH: To illustrate my point even further: "Subprime mortgages accounted for 9 percent of all mortgage originations from 1996 through 2004." But that 9% became 21% from 2004 to 2006, 21% of all mortgages were subprime. Twenty-one percent of all mortgages were essentially money given away to people because they were loans made to people that everybody knew going in would never pay them back. And that 21% of the mortgage market being subprime equaled about $600,000 billion in 2006, which was at the time one-fifth of the US home loan market.

GetttinHomesick, your response is a totally bogus obfuscation...

1. You are afraid to admit that you belive it is the function of government to make sure American own a home. Of course, that is because admission would result in you immediatly being blown out of the water.
Mixing politics and mortgage policy is like mixing oil and water: good for salads, but not for the economy. This is the reason that the free market rules dont apply.

2. "...any debate on the "Housing Debacle" centers around Bush and his Dec 1993 ADDI."

You are fibbbbbbing!

While corruption and undue influence are not entirely the province of Democrats, the overwhelming control of this area of the economy was due to the machinations of Democratic politicians.

Social justice aspirations of politicians resulted in the meltdown, which, it is well documented, was clearly warned against. Private business followed the lead of government policy, both due to pressureand due to greed.

From the Village Voice analysis of Fannie and Freddie:
<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-08-05/news/how-andrew-cuomo-gave-birth-to-the-crisis-at-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac/">Andrew Cuomo and Fannie and Freddie - Page 1 - News - New York - Village Voice</a>

a. "There are as many starting points for the mortgage meltdown as there are fears about how far it has yet to go, but one decisive point of departure is the final years of the Clinton administration, when a kid from Queens without any real banking or real-estate experience was the only man in Washington with the power to regulate the giants of home finance, the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), better known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

b. The Washington Post noted this June that the GSEs' aggressive acquisitions "created a market for more such lending" by others, feeding the fire. That June Post story focused its critical reassessment of HUD's affordable-housing goals on the department's 2004 decisionduring the Bush re-election campaignto juice them up again, pushing the target to 56 percent by 2007, [Cuomos increases] exceeded Bush's more gradual six-point increase.

3. How convenient to begin the debate at 1993...
When the actual start of the debacle was the presidency of the Democrat FDR.

a. Fannie Mae was started in 1938 by FDR, with a billion dollars, to buy up mortgages from private lenders so that those banks would have more capital to lend. By 1968 the huge loan portfolio weighed on the federal budget, so that President Johnson converted it into a publically traded quasi-governmental corporation. Get it? It was designed to appear to be a free market entity. But everyone knew that the government wouldnt allow them to fail, giving it an unfair advantage over its competition, and access to guaranteed lines of credit and exemption from state and local taxes. Then they used the same track for Freddie Mac. Then, in September 08, the government took back control of the two, along with $5 trillion in mortgage liabilities.

4. While it must be admitted that Presiden Bush also saw home ownership as a government priority, every cornerstone of this sad tale is Democrat, from GRE's to CRA to HUD to Frank and Dodd.

The problem is based on political philosophy. Once you admit to a bias in favor of government guaranteeing home ownership, you had better be able to explain why government should be responsible for cars, food, and even clothing for all citizens.

And, of course, I'm sure you could explain where the revenue for same should come from...let me guess: Limbaugh!

Hey, TakinTheArsenic, how come you're hiding from the question of government role in housing?

Totally understandable...after all, once you admit that you're for it, your in deep, deep trouble.

I double dog dare ya'...defend the premise that your side must subscribe to....if I may end a sentence with a preposition.

Here, let me show you how you'd sound: "Oh, yeah...gov is so rich they should not guarantee houses for folks...they should buy them for 'em!

And then get them cars, so they can get to work! Big shiny cars! As good as rich people have....maybe better one!! 'Cause it's not fair if everyone isn't equal! Yeah, equal!

And good cloths, too!
(Probably the right jewelry, too, 'cause, you know, it's so difficult to accessorize.)

See, RideTheBroomstick....that's why you won't admit that you believe that government should have a role in guaranteeing homes for citizens. The premise is so flawed....

But, it explains why more Democrats support socialism than other groups.

"The most striking partisan differences come in reactions to the word "socialism." Just 15% of Republicans react positively to "socialism" while 77% react negatively. By more than two-to-one (64% to 26%), independents also have a negative impression of "socialism." However, Democrats are evenly divided -- 44% have a positive reaction to "socialism" while 43% react negatively." <a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1583/political-rhetoric-capitalism-socialism-militia-family-values-states-rights">"Socialism" Not So Negative, "Capitalism" Not So Positive - Pew Research Center</a>

Toro, not quite clear as to why you maintain this, but the more time goes by, the more expert opinion disagees with your premise.

1. The question of how well CRA loans have performed is of vital importance because of the trillions of dollars in such lending. During the first 15 years of the acts existence, total announced commitments under the CRA totaled $9 billion. But starting in 1992, volume exploded. Over the next 16 years, from 1992 to 2008, announced CRA commitments totaled $6 trillion. And incredible though it may seem, the same federal regulators who forced the CRA on banks have neglected to track the performance of trillions of dollars of loans made to satisfy it. But there is a strong prima facie case that they constitute toxic lending that is, lending that leads to unsustainable loans, resulting in an unacceptable level of foreclosures.

2. approximately 50 percent of CRA loans for single-family residences were nevertheless made to borrowers who made down payments of 5 percent or less or had low credit scores characteristics that indicated high credit risk. Whether or not anyone called these loans subprime, in other words, the chances are good that many of them have defaulted or remain at high risk of doing so.

3. Though the feds, again, havent collected figures for CRA loans performance as a whole, we do have statistics from a few lenders that are troubling indeed. In Cleveland, Third Federal Savings and Loan has a 35 percent delinquency rate on its CRA-mandated Home Today loans, versus a 2 percent delinquency rate on its nonHome Today portfolio. Chicagos Shorebankthe nations first community development bank, with largely CRA-related loans on its bookshas a 19 percent delinquency and nonaccrual rate for its portfolio of first-mortgage loans for single-family residences. And Bank of America said in 2008 that while its CRA loans constituted 7 percent of its owned residential-mortgage portfolio, they represented 29 percent of that portfolios net losses. <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_snd-cra.html">Yes, the CRA Is Toxic by Edward Pinto, City Journal Autumn 2009</a>

Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) speaking at a forum on national housing policy on December 11, 2006. Three weeks after making this speech at the Treasury Department, Frank became Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
Frank on Democrats taking over regulatory reform:
You will see far less difference with Democrats taking over in the Financial Services regulatory area than in virtually any other area of public policy, because we did work together on things like regulatory relief and we have more to do yet in the deregulation. One of the things we did was try to reduce the reporting requirements from the banks to the financial detectives."

5. Further, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae increased making risky loans from 42% to 50% of their loans.
Democrat Senator Dodd fully backed the program, and concurrently received sweetheart mortgage-loans on property that he owns. Topic Galleries -- Courant.com He and Democrat Representative Barney Frank thwarted Bush Administration attempts to rein in the loans, ( Frank's fingerprints are all over the financial fiasco - The Boston Globe ) many of which fell under the slogan NINJA loans: no income, no job, no assets.

But, it was fun finding new appellations for you.

If by "shredding" you mean "running from" you might have a a point.
You brought up 30 year mortgages from 70 and 40 years ago as the cause of the Bush housing crash. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

2004 was the year sub-prime loans jumped from 9% to 21% and Bush's Dec 2003 ADDI was the cause, not something that happened in 1938!

I'm not quite sure why you think I would think otherwise, other than massive cognitive dissonance on your part. I have repeatedly posted studies and conclusions by experts backed by statistical analysis who have refuted the claims you've made below.

1. The question of how well CRA loans have performed is of vital importance because of the trillions of dollars in such lending. During the first 15 years of the act’s existence, total announced commitments under the CRA totaled $9 billion. But starting in 1992, volume exploded. Over the next 16 years, from 1992 to 2008, announced CRA commitments totaled $6 trillion. And incredible though it may seem, the same federal regulators who forced the CRA on banks have neglected to track the performance of trillions of dollars of loans made to satisfy it. But there is a strong prima facie case that they constitute toxic lending —that is, lending that leads to unsustainable loans, resulting in an unacceptable level of foreclosures.

2. …approximately 50 percent of CRA loans for single-family residences were nevertheless made to borrowers who made down payments of 5 percent or less or had low credit scores— characteristics that indicated high credit risk. Whether or not anyone called these loans “subprime,” in other words, the chances are good that many of them have defaulted or remain at high risk of doing so.

3. Though the feds, again, haven’t collected figures for CRA loans’ performance as a whole, we do have statistics from a few lenders that are troubling indeed. In Cleveland, Third Federal Savings and Loan has a 35 percent delinquency rate on its CRA-mandated “Home Today” loans, versus a 2 percent delinquency rate on its non–Home Today portfolio. Chicago’s Shorebank—the nation’s first community development bank, with largely CRA-related loans on its books—has a 19 percent delinquency and nonaccrual rate for its portfolio of first-mortgage loans for single-family residences. And Bank of America said in 2008 that while its CRA loans constituted 7 percent of its owned residential-mortgage portfolio, they represented 29 percent of that portfolio’s net losses. <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_snd-cra.html">Yes, the CRA Is Toxic by Edward Pinto, City Journal Autumn 2009</a>

This simply is not true. The Federal Reserve has tracked the performance of CRA loans, and they have concluded that the performance of those loans has been in line with industry standards.

5. Further, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae increased making risky loans from 42% to 50% of their loans.
Democrat Senator Dodd fully backed the program, and concurrently received sweetheart mortgage-loans on property that he owns. Topic Galleries -- Courant.com He and Democrat Representative Barney Frank thwarted Bush Administration attempts to rein in the loans, ( Frank's fingerprints are all over the financial fiasco - The Boston Globe ) many of which fell under the slogan “NINJA” loans: no income, no job, no assets.

Yet the GSE's share of such loans declined relative to the private sector.

6. US News, and Spectator agree: CRA major cause.

You and these articles are merely using anecdotes and conjecture. Using one small bank as the US News article hardly qualifies as a broad-based conclusion based on statistical evidence, of which your argument is completely lacking. As the American Spectator states

<quote>
Although it is difficult to prove cause and effect, it is highly likely that the lower lending standards required by the CRA influenced what banks and other lenders were willing to offer to borrowers in prime markets.
</quote>
This is merely conjecture because they can't prove cause and effect.

Let's go over what we know

- 6% of all subprime loans were made into CRA areas
- the rate of default on those loans were no greater than non-CRA loans
- 24 of the top 25 subprime lenders had no CRA mandate
- the rate of home price growth and collapse in CRA areas was no greater than in non-CRA areas. In fact, it lagged in the worst markets, most of which were overwhelmingly middle and upper middle class and usually in the Sun Belt, just like all other real estate booms and busts.

Yet we are supposed to believe that the CRA was responsible for this mess. Only conservatives who have a vested interest in shifting blame make this argument.

I can be convinced otherwise. I believe a government agency - the Federal Reserve - was primarily responsible for this. But thus far, the critics have produced zero statistical evidence to back up their arguments, and all the statistical evidence that I have seen refutes them.

EDIT - The American Spectator uses a source which contradicts their argument. This is an expansion of the quote above.

<quote>
Sure enough, according to data published by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, from 2001 through 2006, the share of all mortgage originations that were made up of conventional mortgages (that is, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that had always been the mainstay of the U.S. mortgage market) fell from 57.1 percent in 2001 to 33.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006. Correspondingly, sub-prime loans (those made to borrowers with blemished credit) rose from 7.2 percent to 18.8 percent, and Alt-A loans (those made to speculative buyers or without the usual underwriting standards) rose from 2.5 percent to 13.9 percent. Although it is difficult to prove cause and effect, it is highly likely that the lower lending standards required by the CRA influenced what banks and other lenders were willing to offer to borrowers in prime markets. Needless to say, most borrowers would prefer a mortgage with a low down payment requirement, allowing them to buy a larger home for the same initial investment.
</quote>
Yet, the same Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University clearly refutes the American Spectator

<quote>
There are many causes to the collapse of the housing market and the recent financial turmoil, but the contribution of the CRA appears marginal. While banks did engage in subprime lending in their assessment areas, they did so at a lower rate than the market in general and accounted for only a small fraction of subprime loans to lower-income borrowers and lower income neighborhoods. The data suggest that far from being forced into risky corners of the market, the institutions under the scrutiny of the CRA were crowded out by unregulated lenders.

banks were discriminating, breaking the law, and not serving the people in poorer neighborhoods with services they offered to ALL of their other customers.

simple as that....

once CRA was passed, banks began loaning to those people wanting to buy a home in their poorer neighborhood....for the past near 40 years, millions of poor people were then able to get these smaller home loans for their cheaper housing in their poorer neighborhoods at higher interest rates than the basic conventional loan due to their supposed higher risk...and they have kept in good standing for the most part....many have paid off these loans, over the 40 some years.

Just because a person works and is still poor does not mean they are at a high risk for the banks..... my inlaws were piss poor, got a loan (at a higher interest rate) for their home, which was $7000 dollars, and they paid it off after 20 years....homes in richer neighborhoods were running about $35k.....when they bought theirs for the $7k.....

just because one is not wealthy, does not mean they should not be given a chance to buy a home of lesser value, that they can afford.

MOST SUBPRIME LOANS issued to customers WERE NOT issued to custmers in the CRA Mandate areas....

I truly don't know how much CLEARER this can be frank?

there WAS NO GVT mandate Frank....the banks CHOSE VIA FREEWILL to loan haphazardly.

Toro, the only political as opposed to an economic question is whether the implementation of CRA was done with a clear and public goal of creating a housing bubble? The answer is yes. Secondarily was this goal stated first by the Ds or the Rs? The answer is the Ds.

I do know, however, that the CRA was not responsible for the housing bubble. That is ludicrous.

I don't think the GSEs were responsible either, or at least primarily responsible. (They had to have had some role since they were so large.) But pinning the blame on the GSEs is infinitely more plausible than blaming the CRA.
</quote>
While I agree that the Ds (and Rs) incompetently pursued this goal of using the CRA to increase homeownership i. e. a bubble, a bubble did in fact form and like any other uncoerced confession this creates a strong presumption of guilt. At this point proof of effectively zero culpability is needed and indirect culpability in the form of jawboning is effectively impossible to disprove. This argument cannot be won with all of the public statements made to the effect that "We'uns is going to see that anyone with a pulse can get a house, cheap." Just give it up Cisneros and Cuomo lost this argument for you nearly 20 years ago.

No, Care, banks were exercising their fiduciary responsibility in giving loans were they saw the best chance of getting the return that they, as a business, required.

This view belongs in the pew, but not in the boardroom.

"a. Congress passed a bill in 1975 requiring banks to provide the government with information on their lending activities in poor urban areas. Two years later, it passed the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which gave regulators the power to deny banks the right to expand if they didnt lend sufficiently in those neighborhoods. In 1979 the FDIC used the CRA to block a move by the Greater NY Savings Bank for not enough lending.

b. In 1986, when the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn) threatened to oppose an acquisition by a southern bank, Louisiana Bancshares, until it agreed to new flexible credit and underwriting standards for minority borrowersfor example, counting public assistance and food stamps as income.

c, ACORN then attacked Fannie Mae, the giant quasi-government agency that bought loans from banks in order to allow them to make new loans. Its underwriters were strictly by-the-book interpreters of lending standards and turned down purchases of unconventional loans, charged Acorn. The pressure eventually paid off. In 1992, Congress passed legislation requiring Fannie Mae and the similar Freddie Mac to devote 30 percent of their loan purchases to mortgages for low- and moderate-income borrowers.

d. Clinton Administration housing secretary, Henry Cisneros, declared that he would expand homeownership among lower- and lower-middle-income renters. His strategy: pushing for no-down-payment loans; expanding the size of mortgages that the government would insure against losses; and using the CRA and other lending laws to direct more private money into low-income programs.

Where is the responsibility from the Right?

The Right argues that we all have individual responsibility. Yet PC just argued that banks had a "fiduciary duty" to make bad loans to get a return. The Right's whole argument on the CRA is that it lowered lending standards, causing a Housing Bubble. Putting aside the incorrect notion that executives have a fiduciary duty to make bad business decisions, this argument absolves individuals of their individual responsibility to act in a prudent manner (which in fact violates an individuals fiduciary duty).

The Right doesn't usually buy blaming society when an individual, or many individuals, do the wrong thing. The Right argues that every individual makes a choice, and every individual should bear the consequences of that choice. Yet the Right is blaming society for the Housing Crisis, saying people "had" to lower their credit standards universally because of this one small part of the market. People did not have to lower their credit standards. Those were choices made by individuals.

"The market" is a collective. It is a vast group of individuals setting prices. Saying "Everyone else was doing it, so we have to do it to" - which is what the Right is arguing when they say credit standards were lowered because of the CRA - is no different than someone trying to absolve their bad behavior by blaming society.

I track the performance of over 500 publicly traded banks and thrifts. The majority of those banks and thrifts made money during the Financial Crisis. Many banks acted prudently. So banks did not have to lower their lending standards across the market in response to this one small part of the lending market.

Putting aside the incorrect notion that executives have a fiduciary duty to make bad business decisions, this argument absolves individuals of their individual responsibility to act in a prudent manner (which in fact violates an individuals fiduciary duty).

The Right doesn't usually buy blaming society when an individual, or many individuals, do the wrong thing. The Right argues that every individual makes a choice, and every individual should bear the consequences of that choice. Yet the Right is blaming society for the Housing Crisis, saying people "had" to lower their credit standards universally because of this one small part of the market. People did not have to lower their credit standards. Those were choices made by individuals.

"The market" is a collective. It is a vast group of individuals setting prices. Saying "Everyone else was doing it, so we have to do it to" - which is what the Right is arguing when they say credit standards were lowered because of the CRA - is no different than someone trying to absolve their bad behavior by blaming society.

I track the performance of over 500 publicly traded banks and thrifts. The majority of those banks and thrifts made money during the Financial Crisis. Many banks acted prudently. So banks did not have to lower their lending standards across the market in response to this one small part of the lending market.

If CRA loans are such a great investment why would the government have to force banks to make them?

banks were discriminating, breaking the law, and not serving the people in poorer neighborhoods with services they offered to ALL of their other customers.

simple as that....

once CRA was passed, banks began loaning to those people wanting to buy a home in their poorer neighborhood....for the past near 40 years, millions of poor people were then able to get these smaller home loans for their cheaper housing in their poorer neighborhoods at higher interest rates than the basic conventional loan due to their supposed higher risk...and they have kept in good standing for the most part....many have paid off these loans, over the 40 some years.

Just because a person works and is still poor does not mean they are at a high risk for the banks..... my inlaws were piss poor, got a loan (at a higher interest rate) for their home, which was $7000 dollars, and they paid it off after 20 years....homes in richer neighborhoods were running about $35k.....when they bought theirs for the $7k.....

just because one is not wealthy, does not mean they should not be given a chance to buy a home of lesser value, that they can afford.

MOST SUBPRIME LOANS issued to customers WERE NOT issued to custmers in the CRA Mandate areas....

I truly don't know how much CLEARER this can be frank?

there WAS NO GVT mandate Frank....the banks CHOSE VIA FREEWILL to loan haphazardly.

It is your progressive misunderstanding of the role of both business and of government that forces you to hold the jaundiced view i.e., "banks were discriminating, breaking the law, and not serving the people in poorer neighborhoods..."

This view belongs in the pew, but not in the boardroom.
And is the best evidence that Democrat, liberal, progressive policies caused the crisis.

"there WAS NO GVT mandate Frank....the banks CHOSE VIA FREEWILL to loan haphazardly."
While it is absolutely essential for those of your perspective to propound this mistaken viewpoint, the facts run counter...

"a. Congress passed a bill in 1975 requiring banks to provide the government with information on their lending activities in poor urban areas. Two years later, it passed the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which gave regulators the power to deny banks the right to expand if they didnt lend sufficiently in those neighborhoods. In 1979 the FDIC used the CRA to block a move by the Greater NY Savings Bank for not enough lending.

b. In 1986, when the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn) threatened to oppose an acquisition by a southern bank, Louisiana Bancshares, until it agreed to new flexible credit and underwriting standards for minority borrowersfor example, counting public assistance and food stamps as income.

c, ACORN then attacked Fannie Mae, the giant quasi-government agency that bought loans from banks in order to allow them to make new loans. Its underwriters were strictly by-the-book interpreters of lending standards and turned down purchases of unconventional loans, charged Acorn. The pressure eventually paid off. In 1992, Congress passed legislation requiring Fannie Mae and the similar Freddie Mac to devote 30 percent of their loan purchases to mortgages for low- and moderate-income borrowers.

d. Clinton Administration housing secretary, Henry Cisneros, declared that he would expand homeownership among lower- and lower-middle-income renters. His strategy: pushing for no-down-payment loans; expanding the size of mortgages that the government would insure against losses; and using the CRA and other lending laws to direct more private money into low-income programs.

e..... Freddie Mac, for instance, started approving low-income buyers with bad credit histories or none at all,...

f. Pressuring nonbank lenders to make more loans to poor minorities didnt stop with Sears. If it didnt happen, Clinton officials warned, theyd seek to extend CRA regulations "

The obvious "error" is the standard CON$ervative deception, tell just enough truth and then shut up, or in other words, lie to someone's ignorance.

Clearly there is no mention of Bush's ADDI in your smokescreen even though your own link alludes to it without naming it outright to protect the guilty. Those "legislators" were Bush and the GOP controlled Congress and the legislation was the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) which changed the rules to allow no downpayment loans for more than the house was worth to people with bad credit who could not keep up with the payments and who were at least 20% below the standard for the neighborhood they were buying into.

Not content that nearly seven in ten American households owned their own homes, legislators in 2004 pressed new affordable-housing goals on the two mortgage giants, which through 2007 purchased some $1 trillion in loans to lower- and moderate-income buyers.

Fannie And Freddie Join The PartyPrior to the downgrade and the cloud that eventually hung over subprime securities, even Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, once known for buying the safest kind of mortgages, got into the game. Following an accounting scandal that temporarily slowed down their mortgage-buying business between 2003-2005, Fannie and Freddie felt compelled to compete with Wall Street for a share of all those subprime loans being sold by their originators. So Fannie and Freddie lowered their standards, just as the lenders had done. They began buying lesser-quality mortgages, including subprime loans, exactly the kind they avoided years earlier.

The point that either you missed, or I didn't make clearly- although I believe I've said the same thing in different ways- is that the industry should not have been hounded to give loans to folks who did not fit the characteristics of GOOD loan risks.

Folks on the left pretend that anyone who doesn't do their bidding is evil...bankers are evil, white folks are evil, the country is evil....

No: 'redlining' is spotlighting areas that are outside of the risk-reward theatre that a private business is interesting in serving, not spotlighting black folks.....

No, I'm trying to refute this notion that the CRA caused the crisis. This is solely a right-wing political narrative. It did not.

Of course, the government has some effect. It is a large player in the mortgage market. But all bubbles are a creation of excess credit. All of them. So the GSEs play a role in that they provide liquidity to the mortgage market. And they became a systemic risk not because of the liquidity they provided - they have been doing that for 70 years - but because they became too leveraged, which they should not have been allowed to do. The Democrats deserve their requisite amount of blame because they are the prime enablers of Freddie and Fannie. But in this, Freddie and Fannie were acting no differently than Wall Street, which also leveraged themselves up to the hilt. It also doesn't explain why the rest of the world also experienced a housing bubble either.

The biggest influence on credit is the Federal Reserve, which is a government agency. And the Federal Reserve IMHO and the opinion of many others is the primary cause of this mess primarily by keeping interest rates too low and creating too much money, but also allowing for deregulation and refusing to even acknowledge there was a housing bubble, as Bernanke did at his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in 2006. So if you say "the government" caused the crisis, I agree in that the Fed was the primary enabler.

However, de-regulation and Wall Street also played a significant role because both allowed and supplied the ocean of liquidity that swamped the housing markets. De-regulation and letting Wall Street do whatever it wants are primarily Republican causes. So when you are pointing fingers at the Democrats, you can point them right back at the Republicans for helping create this mess.

And, PC my dear, Dodd-Frank came after the Housing Bubble. So blaming Dodd-Frank is a tad silly.

Bull, the CRA had nothing to do with race per se. It dealt solely with income levels and location. The fair lending act and other laws created a more or less playing field for wealthy and middleclass Blacks who headed out to the suburbs and let the financial structure of the ghettos collapse. The CRA was a reaction to Black flight not white flight.

If a car speeds by you 50 mph above the speed limit, it doesn't force you or everyone else to drive 50 mph above the speed limit either. You make a choice to do so.

Individuals made conscious decisions of their own volition to extend horrendous loans that had absolutely zero, zip, nada to do with the CRA. A sliver of the mortgage market did NOT cause bank executives and lending officers to start acting like madmen.

Blaming society? FHA DPA was a direct result of Clinton turning up the heat on banks with the CRA, Sub Prime prior to this was a 20%+ DP with rates at 4 to 5 percent above par.....

Those individuals you're describing wouldn't be Clinton, Greenspan, Summer, Rubin and Levitt? Didn't they claim Brooksley Born was way off about the derivatives market? That didn't hold water either....

The goal to open up housing to anyone that could put fog on a mirror was a bad idea, and they used every means possible to do it, the CRA is were it all started, don't stay in denial too long....

If a car speeds by you 50 mph above the speed limit, it doesn't force you or everyone else to drive 50 mph above the speed limit either. You make a choice to do so.

Individuals made conscious decisions of their own volition to extend horrendous loans that had absolutely zero, zip, nada to do with the CRA. A sliver of the mortgage market did NOT cause bank executives and lending officers to start acting like madmen. Credit standards always wax and wane in the cycle, but no government policy forced banks and other mortgage providers to extend NINJAs to speculators flipping condos.

These three loan types helped the GSEs meet their affordable housing (AH) mandates under the "Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992" (GSE Act). They were materially assisted in this effort by big banks and thrifts originating trillions in high risk loans to meet another mandate established under the federal Community Investment Act (CRA).

Speaking of CRA, let us not forget Krugman's assertion that CRA's involvement in the financial crisis is a myth. Over the 17 year period 1992-2008, there was a total of $6 trillion in announced CRA commitments, covering all types of CRA lending. Ninety-four percent of this $6 trillion in commitments were issued by four banks or banks these four ended up purchasing by way of merger. The banks were Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, and Bank of America. As a result, CRA single family origination volume over the period 1993-2008 also exploded, totaling an estimated $2.7 trillion.

<post author="finebead" datetime="2011-01-28T22:18:00" id="p242">
The original post says CRA was not a BIG contributor to the financial crisis. I agree with the original post. What were the big contributors?

1. Greenspan set rates too low in 2003 and 2004, fully 3 years after the 2001 recession ended when fed funds was at a 40 year low of 1%. Congress had given Bush his tax cut in 2001 and more tax cut in 2003, but they failed to adequately stimulate the economy, he was in danger of losing the election in 2004 and Greenspan continued to lower rates to levels not seen since the Kennedy years. This enabled lenders to offer ARM's with very low 2 year teaser rates, people could afford the first 2 years and they were lied to about what the rate would actually rise to, so they bought the house hoping it would go up in value and they would sell it in 2 years (the greater fool theory, I will find a bigger fool than me to buy it in 2 years). Excess liquidity directly contributed to the crisis in a BIG way.

2. Excess bank leverage at the 5 big investment banks, Lehman, Merrill, Bear, Goldman, and Morgan. The SEC in 2003 relaxed the Net Capital rule to allow those 5 banks to expand their leverage from 15:1 to 45:1. The SEC was to provide oversight to the banks own internal risk mgmt, but the SEC never provided it, and the banks did lever themselves up to 30 or 40 to 1, killing Lehman, and fire sales on Merrill and Bear. Goldman was dead but was bailed out by the TARP money that AIG got, which funded to payment to Goldman on their Credit Default Swaps at AIG. This excess leverage was what provided the DEMAND for the garbage mortgages. The investment banks could "securitize" them, get them rated AAA, and sell them to dupes all over the world. This vastly expanded their profits and earned all their CEO's huge bonuses and gains on stock option packages, right up until the companies were dead meat, bankrupt or sold for pennies on the dollar, or rescued by the govt. (Goldman via AIG).

3. Fraud at the Rating Agencies. The rating agencies were rating bundles of junk mortgages as AAA debt, when none of the debt in it was AAA. The rating agency said this was OK because since WWII, there was never a year when housing prices in the US fell. Well, whoopie doo, in the great depression housing prices in the US fell for over a year. This was a huge problem, alchemy turning junk into AAA.

4. Unscrupulous mortgage companies making loans to people who clearly would never be able to repay the loan after the low initial teaser rate reset to a higher rate. This was NOT caused by CRA, not at Countrywide, nor at New Century (the two largest issuers of subprime mortgages from 2002-2006), nor at countless others mortgage companies. Why were those loans made? They were made because Wall St. (Lehman, Merrill, Bear, Goldman, Morgan) WANTED those bad loans, to "securitize" them, take them to the rating agencies, pay them to rate the junk as AAA, and sell them and make a big profit.

5. The failure of the Federal Reserve to adequately regulate mortgage lending and bank reserves. Greenspan had the authority to regulate much of this activity already if he chose to use it, but he did not. He testified before congress that he made a mistake, that he believed the banks internal instinct for self preservation was adequate for the bank to regulate themselves. Clearly the greed of the CEO and executive team to enrich themselves, at the ultimate expense of all the rest of the shareholders who eventually got trashed, was a stronger incentive, and the CEO's and executive team trashed the shareholders while they all enriched themselves. Greenspan failed big time.

6. Stupid people paying too much for a house, not understanding what they can afford in the long run, not understanding the terms of the mortgage documents they signed, and putting too much faith in the words of the mortgage company sales person selling them the mortgage (who clearly was lying to the purchasers).

7. Failure of the congress to regulate Fannie and Freddie, the last opportunity to avert a crash was 2005, with HR 1461 that passed 331-90 in the house, and S 190 which Bill Frist R-Tenn. as senate majority leader refused to even let the bill be voted on by the full senate after is was passed out of committee.

When I look at my top 5 causes of the crisis, CRA is not in the top 5. Therefore it is not a big cause of the crisis. Therefore, the original poster is correct, CRA was not a big cause of the financial crisis.

Was it a contributor? Probably so. Was it a BIG contributor? No, not in the top 5 to my way of looking at it. CRA was only a minor contributor, but it probably played a role, just not a big role.

And to repeat as has been mentioned earlier, of the $1.2 trillion issuance of subprime loans in those two years, 24 of the 25 largest lenders had no CRA mandate, and CRA loans accounted for only 6% of those loans in 2006.

I work in the financial industry. I am a money manager and a fiduciary for a large fund. If I were to flame out and use the excuse "Everyone else was doing it," I would be fired and would almost certainly would be violating my duty to act as a fiduciary for those who entrusted me with their capital.

It is no excuse for individuals to throw prudence and standards out the window simply because they have the tools to do so. The guy who invented the match and the guy who invented kerosene are not responsible for the guy who douses the forest and sets it on fire. Or for an analogy those on the right can really understand - guns don't kill people, people kill people. It is not the fault of the CRA that shops like New Century decided to recklessly abandon sound lending practices by extending garbage loans to middle class folks in the suburbs buying condos with no money down in Naples because banks had a government mandate to extend credit in redlined areas.

We have a sizable fixed income team that invests a lot of money in bonds and structured products. I have been exposed to deals in structured finance. My group in 2006 looked at entering into a multi-billion dollar swap whereby the underlying collateral was a mezzanine subprime "AAA" CDO. I passed. That POS was trading at pennies on the dollar a few years later. I am responsible for my actions as an investment professional. The individuals who decided to throw sound practices out the window in the pursuit of profit are responsible for their actions, not the CRA.

Detailed performance data for single-family CRA lending is rarely published. In a search of the top 25 banks by single family mortgage holdings, only Third Federal Savings &amp; Loan reported on its CRA loans.

- Third Federal Savings &amp; Loan reported that its "Home Today" community development program constituted just 3.2% of its owned mortgage loan portfolio ($299.3 million), yet these loans represented 32% of its 90+ delinquencies. Its Home Today delinquency rate is 33% vs. 2% on its non-Home Today portfolio.

I ask this question: Would the housing bubble and financial crisis have occurred had the CRA never existed? This is another way of asking if the CRA caused the crisis, which is the point of this thread. And this is what we know;

- The housing bubble was global. It wasn't just national. The CRA could not possibly have caused housing bubbles in other countries, of which many were relatively bigger than in America. How did the CRA cause an explosion of lending in Norway?

- The housing bubble followed the tech bubble. That is not a coincidence. We experienced one of the biggest financial bubbles of all time, only to be followed by an even bigger financial bubble a mere few years later. This was in big part a result of government, i.e. monetary, policy. Easy monetary policy was a reaction to the tech bubble as the Fed was trying to avoid a repeat of the 1930s. That easy money was channeled into the housing market. The tech bubble was not caused by the CRA, nor did the CRA cause the subsequent monetary response.

- The emergence of China, along with deflation in Japan, created a vast pool of savings in Asia looking for a safe home in dollars. That massive pool of capital was re-cycled into the US bond market, via purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgages, lowering interest rates across the curve. The economic condition of Asia had nothing to do with the CRA.

- Securitization exploded. Low interest rates caused asset/liability problems as pension plans and insurance companies which relied on bonds to generate their actuarial return, were falling short. Securitization created "AAA" products out garbage, which fed the Wall Street machine, as garbage in / garbage out created alchemy that investors swallowed whole. This is why Wall Street firms such as Merrill Lynch bought mortgage origination companies, so they had a steady supply of inventory to feed investors "AAA" rated product 20 to 30 basis points above Treasuries. Wall Street also created other products such as synthetic CDOs and CDO-squareds as financial alchemy to flog to investors. This explosion in financial "technology" happened independent of the CRA, and the demand for shitty subprime and alt-A loans was happening outside of the CRA. This was the dynamic that created all the crap mortgages, not the CRA. Had the CRA not existed, crappy liar's loans would have been created anyways.

- This housing bubble is not unique. Almost all housing bubbles throughout time look pretty much the same. The only difference this time was the scale, which was massive. Housing bubbles, as well as other asset bubbles such as the tech bubble, follow a pretty well-defined pattern. They are always a function of the excess creation of credit, they are usually followed by some period of prosperity, and there is usually some exogenous shock or change from outside the system. The CRA is so small relative to the forces that were and still are buffeting the global economy.

So I look at those factors and conclude that the CRA was inconsequential to the Financial Crisis. I'm not being dogmatic about it. If someone could provide evidence, I would change my mind. Nor am I arguing that the CRA was wise policy. I have no opinion on whether it was or not. But I do know that it didn't cause the Financial Crisis.

Truth, back in the 90’s when we first got C-SPAN in our home, being an independent contractor, I watched or recorded for watching later in the evening all politically/economically relevant debates and hearings.

Once I had more time to take the time to read, I subscribed to the WSJ dropping “Time magazine” and “US News &amp; World Report” as not being worth the cost of their subscriptions for lack of useful content.

Early on, in reading the WSJ, I came across warnings about Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, of particular interest to me since I was a land developer and home builder, and my wife was a realtor. Both of us were dependent on the mortgage markets to sustain our livelihoods.

I began to follow all reports on F&amp;F, and saw how, over time, the warnings turned into reality. At each phase of the development of the problem I asked “How the heck is this going to play out, that will be relevant to us in a practical way, and to our country?"

In my business I was always held to tough loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, but I benefitted from people on the other side of the transaction being able to get their loans with less and less stringent requirements. In the early days about everyone went to a local bank for their mortgage loans. But with the ever increasing availability of "specially taylored" financing to buyers in both my wife's and my areas of real-estate, we began to see so called Mortgage Brokers entering the market-place, configuring loans to people with ever looser standards for income, employment, credit-worthiness, and ability to repay. So much money was available for homes, everyone and his brother got into the action - for a generous fee, as "mortgage brokers".

The average buyer of questionable credit would, by going on the internet, find a “Mortgage broker” able to procure them a loan, almost always adding very large “loan procurement” fees to the price of the house to be financed at the closing table. In almost every case, if the person had had a sound credit rating in the first place (and for us most did) they could’ve saved themselves (or the seller) a large sum of money (5 to 8 points of loan value) which would have to be financed over the period of the loan, or kicked in by the seller so as to close the deal.

The purchasers seemed ignorant or unheeding that their local mortgage lending bank would willingly make the loan with only nominal closing costs for legal attorney fees, title insurance, recording fees, all usually totalling less than $300 vs. $8-10,000 per transaction; truly amazing! Unfortunately the average American is sadly lacking in any economic education, and is easily taken in by marketing, and their over-confidence in their own ability to get a really good deal on the internet.

Since appraisals, to facilitate business, were coming in at almost any increased amount that satisfied the (asking and bid) price, buyers on selling naturally wanted or needed to recapture their purchase price, a decent increase, plus the cost of the sales commission, and legal and closing costs. There was an ever greater pressure for prices to increase faster than normal. (your real estate bubble)

"Normal" in this case is what had existed back when more stringent standards disciplines were the practice such as 80% LTV, a decent job history, eligible income, and satisfactory credit rating/history for would be borrowers.

Back in the late nineties the WSJ began warning of the potential disastrous issues which would result from the GSEs F&amp;F, comparing that potential with the earlier S&amp;L crisis, or coming next their COUSIN in implied government guarantee, the PBGC (Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation), the next foot to fall. =&gt; <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pension-crisis-likely-to-hit-taxpayers-eventually-2009-09-03">WSJ Market Watch (Sept. 3, 2009) Pension crisis likely to hit taxpayers eventually</a>

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121599777668249845.html?mod=Review-Outlook-US">Fannie Mayhem: A History - WSJ.com</a>
Here are two of the earliest headlines from this list of 30 articles in the WSJ:

“Inside Fannie” 03/19/02 – Fan and Fred don't function like other companies. They're allowed to pile up debt, implicitly guaranteed by taxpayers, without being held to even the minimum of corporate governance standards

“Frantic Fannie” 02/28/02 – Companies taking on so much risk and debt, and backed by taxpayers, ought to be more transparent in what they tell the world

Is the CRA the source of the financial crisis? Would it happened without it? Or is the implied guarantee in the two GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac closer to it?

I believe that if Fannnie and Freddy hadn’t existed, or been subdued, then what resulted from the implied guarantee (with its moral hazard) would not have happened. We exported to economies through our financial markets and then throughout the rest of the world, our greatly over-rated debt instruments. That risk was so great because it was based on the largest sector of our economy most, but any country’s economy, vis the home building and real-estate markets taken as to form a combined sector.

The CRA was a stimulus to the risk; it provided the demographic least able to repay, creating vast numbers of bundled loans going into the securities markets which would be over rated, and then sold worldwide to investors seeking a good return, with demand being stimulated because CD earnings dropped to about 1% or less, in turn because of the availabillity of money for about any purpose driving down those CD rates of return.

I appreciate the effort you put into this post.

Research by Reinhart and Rogoff suggests that an implicit mortgage guarantee by the government has little bearing on the outcome of a housing bubble. Bubbles have occurred with no government backing. The best source is their book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691142165/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1296701277&amp;sr=8-1">This Time is Different</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691142165/">This Time is Different</a>
, but Aftermath of Financial Crisis (http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/rogoff/files/Aftermath.pdf, and more http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/rogoff/Recent_Papers_Rogoff) is a short overview of their conclusions. This boom and bust is proceeding in a similar manner as prior real estate collapses. That doesn't mean the GSEs had no affect. They almost certainly exacerbated the situation. Rather, if asking the question "Would this have happened had the GSEs never existed," the answer is almost certainly "Yes."

The Affirmative Action Lending / CRA did play a part. It may not have been the staring roll but the goal of having Fannie &amp; Freddie drop their lending standards was to increase minority home ownership. There has to be something to it because blacks have defaulted at much higher rates than everyone else.

Black buyers often enter a separate lending universe: A dozen banks and mortgage companies, almost all of which turned big profits making subprime loans, accounted for half the loans given to the regions black middle-income borrowers in 2005 and 2006, according to The Timess analysis. The N.A.A.C.P. has filed a class-action suit against many of the nations largest banks, charging that such lending practices amount to reverse redlining.

the blacks, disproportionately, making over 68k a year in income, were sold by the banks, subprime mortgages when they qualified for conventional mortgages....

NONE of those subprime loans to them were done due to CRA....or fannie or freddie.....from what i can gather.

recent numbers show that CRA loans in foreclosure are minimal....90% of defaulted subprime loans are NOT in CRA areas.

True, that is because Blacks making over 68k a year in income have disproportionately worse credit than the average borrower. Their culture does not value financial responsibility. Their bad credit landed way more of them into subprime status. That was Clinton's goal, by pressuring Fannie &amp; Freddie to lower their lending standards more Blacks would get home loans.

A study by Freddie Mac, confirming earlier Federal Reserve and FDIC studies, contradicts race discrimination arguments for CRA. The study found that African-Americans with annual incomes of $65-$75,000 have on average worse credit records than whites making under $25,000, showing that the difficulty in qualifying was not because of race but because of bad credit records. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas accordingly entitled a paper " <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/1999/swe9903b.pdf">Redlining or Red Herring</a> ?"

Abstract: A growing literature suggests that housing policy, embodied by the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and the affordable housing goals of the government sponsored enterprises, may have caused the subprime crisis. The conclusions drawn in this literature, for the most part, have been based on associations between aggregated national trends. In this paper we examine more directly whether these programs were associated with worse outcomes in the mortgage market, including delinquency rates and measures of loan quality. We rely on two empirical approaches. In the first approach, which focuses on the CRA, we conjecture that historical legacies create significant variations in the lenders that serve otherwise comparable neighborhoods. Because not all lenders are subject to the CRA, this creates a quasi-natural experiment of the CRA's effect. We test this conjecture by examining whether neighborhoods that have been disproportionally served by CRA-covered institutions historically experienced worse outcomes. The second approach takes advantage of the fact that both the CRA and GSE goals rely on clearly defined geographic areas to determine which loans are favored by the regulations. Using a regression discontinuity approach, our tests compare the marginal areas just above and below the thresholds that define eligibility, where any effect of the CRA or GSE goals should be clearest. We find little evidence that either the CRA or the GSE goals played a significant role in the subprime crisis. Our lender tests indicate that areas disproportionately served by lenders covered by the CRA experienced lower delinquency rates and less risky lending. Similarly, the threshold tests show no evidence that either program had a significantly negative effect on outcomes.
