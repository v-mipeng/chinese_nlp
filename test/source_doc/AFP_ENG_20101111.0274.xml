Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings said Thursday that it will
expand its stake in China Construction Bank (CCB) by taking over Bank of
America's (BoA) entitlement in a rights issue.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm that we'll pick up BoA's entitlement in CCB," a Temasek
spokesperson told Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
BoA is entitled to buy 1.79 billion shares in the upcoming rights issue, which
is expected to be completed in early December, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
BoA owns about 11 percent of CCB, while Temasek has around six percent.
</P>
<P>
CCB, China's second largest lender, announced earlier this month that it plans
to raise 9.2 billion US dollars in a rights offering to improve its capital
adequacy ratio as a defence against bad debt.
</P>
<P>
It plans to sell 15.73 billion H shares in Hong Kong, or 0.7 shares for every 10
existing H share, at 4.38 Hong Kong dollars (56 US cents) each.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to sell 630 million A shares in Shanghai at 3.77 yuan each, or 0.7
shares for every 10 existing A share.
</P>
<P>
Mainland banks are looking to replenish their capital after Beijing ordered them
to keep more money in reserve following record lending last year aimed at
boosting the economy during the global downturn.
