NO LONGER SUSTAINABLE, HISTORIC N.H. FAMILY FARM IS PUT ON THE MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOVER, N.H. - Like generations of Tuttles before him, Will Tuttle
has spent
his life on the family farm, working its tree-lined acres from seed
to
harvest. He learned by the side of his father and grandfather and,
like
them, chose to make his living off the land.
</P>
<P>
But after years of toil and dwindling demand for the crops he
produced, the
thick-armed 63-year-old has decided the family legacy will end with
him.
His landmark property - passed from father to son since 1632 and
billed as
the country's oldest continually operating family farm - is up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
Monday as he looked over a rolling field that could be in a
brochure for
local, sustainable agriculture, Tuttle said that like many small
farms, his
had most likely seen its best days.
</P>
<P>
"This is a different business now," he said. "Farming at any
level is a
labor of love, but now the future is so uncertain. Looking forward,
I don't
see much opportunity for small farms to thrive. It's a tough
grind."
</P>
<P>
That reality is behind the disappearance of farms and farmland
in New
England and beyond.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest federal figures, more than 4 million
acres of
active farmland were developed between 2002 and 2007, an area
roughly the
size of Massachusetts. Since 1982, the nation has lost more than 41
million
acres of rural land.
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts has lost 24 percent of its prime farmland since
1982, more
than all but four states.
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Merrill, New Hampshire's commissioner of agriculture
and a
Tuttle's patron, said she was saddened to hear that the family had
decided
to sell. Along the coast, where land values have soared and
suburban sprawl
has intensified, the challenge to farming is especially acute.
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of an era," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 134-acre property, which is listed for $3.35 million, has
been slowly
surrounded by suburban homes and is bordered by a major street. It
is
protected by a conservation restriction that prohibits it from
being
developed after it is sold, and the Tuttles hold out hope that the
new
owners will maintain it as a working farm. But they are quick to
acknowledge that, even with a new niche market for local produce,
working a
small farm these days can be a tough row to hoe.
</P>
<P>
"We're not in a plaza," said Michelle Tuttle, Will's wife. "A
lot of
people won't drive a few extra miles for fresh vegetables. They are
going
to Wal-Mart and Target and trying to save whatever they can, and we
don't
have the buying power to compete."
</P>
<P>
The farm was turning a small profit until the recession, the
Tuttles said.
But in the past three years, as families looked for ways to pare
spending,
business faltered.
</P>
<P>
"Since the economy turned, we've been losing," said Michelle
Tuttle, 43.
</P>
<P>
Founded by English settler John Tuttle, who arrived in the New
World with a
land grant from King Charles II, the farm grew into an institution.
</P>
<P>
Locals looked forward to picking season for months, and tourists
went miles
out of their way for a visit. Even actor Robert De Niro was known
to stop
in now and again.
</P>
<P>
Some came for Tuttle's considerable collection of cheeses,
others for its
fruits and gourmet deli.
</P>
<P>
But Tuttle's calling card has always been its sweet corn.
</P>
<P>
"Ask anyone, they'll tell you, 'We only get our corn from
Tuttle's,"'
Michelle Tuttle said. "People are buying it faster than we can
bring it in
from the field."
</P>
<P>
New customers are often surprised when they find that the corn
is warm to
the touch, she said. "They don't realize it's still hot from the
sun."
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, nearly every customer in the store around lunchtime
bought at
least a couple of ears.
</P>
<P>
"I plan to have it tonight," said Joan Norton, a 74-year-old
from Dover
who visits Tuttle's weekly.
</P>
<P>
Even though she did not grow up on the farm, Michelle Tuttle has
grown to
love it and cried when her husband told her he thought they should
sell it.
</P>
<P>
Will Tuttle is decidedly less nostaglic, even when mulling the
end of a
family enterprise born more than a century before the country
itself. With
the economy and the changing landscape of the small-farming
industry, it
was time, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Fifty-seven years is enough," he said, noting that he was
just 6 when
he began helping out his grandfather. "And I didn't want this to
become a
burden."
</P>
<P>
The Tuttles own a home next door to the farm and plan to move
there when
the sale goes through. After years of backbreaking work, that view
will be
perfect, he said. And thanks to the conservation restriction, the
land, a
lovely vista of fields and woods, will remain largely unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"It's not going anywhere," he said. "It will always stay
beautiful, open
land, and will always be a piece of land with every square inch of
my sweat
on it."
</P>
<P>
Still, when Tuttle considers life without the farm, he grows
wistful, if
only for a moment.
</P>
<P>
"You're gonna have to put a chain on me or I'll pick up a
hoe," he
quipped to his wife, who seemed open to the idea.
</P>
<P>
Though they stand to make a tidy sum from the sale, the Tuttles
say they
will maintain a modest lifestyle. When pressed, Michelle Tuttle
does
mention one dream, to return to Italy, Spain, and Portugal for the
first
time since she and Will eloped there 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are laid-back farm people," she said, noting that she has
no
cellphone or e-mail address. "But going back again would be
nice."
