' THE LOSERS '  IS SILLY, BUT GOOD AT BLOWING STUFF UP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like anyone who goes to the movies regularly, I had to make a
choice about what to see this week.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a screening of "The Losers" or "The Back-up Plan"
-- Jennifer Lopez's new comedy -- I picked the testosterone-ramped
film about double-crossed CIA operatives who join forces with a
sinewy mystery woman set on revenge.
</P>
<P>
The selection may say that I'm drawn by toss-off violence.
Because it's certainly not a J.Lo problem. I've liked the hybrid
singer-actor-producer for years.
</P>
<P>
So here I am, left pondering the weird charms of the latest
comic-book adaptation come to the big screen. And it comes with a
plus: Any film that uses Ram Jam's "Black Betty" and later,
Journey's "Don't Stop Believin' " to delirious effect
automatically gets love.
</P>
<P>
Based on a series by Andy Diggle and illustrator Jock, "The
Losers" stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Clay, or "the Colonel."
</P>
<P>
His betrayed team is an amiable collection of muscular and
lethal gents named Rogue (Idris Elba), Pooch (Columbus Short),
Cougar (Oscar Jaenada) and, not so weird, Jenson (Chris Evans).
</P>
<P>
Zo? Saldana plays Aisha, their dubious associate. For those who
don't know what the pretty Saldana looks like from her turn as
Neytiri in "Avatar," you will now. There's a lot of the lady
here. She arrives tailing Clay around the dives of Bolivia wearing
a revealing ensemble and a porkpie hat.
</P>
<P>
Directed by Sylvain White, "The Losers" is a silly jaunt. Take
it too seriously, and it's probably a little specious about U.S.
power too.
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of good-guys-versus-rotten-apple tension here.
Before being set up, Clay and company liberate a busload of cute
kids and bikini-clad damsels. And make what you will of a
character's wearing of an American flag lapel pin, but "The
Losers" doesn't require the full force of cultural critique.
</P>
<P>
The action is a cacophonous mix of emptied ammo clips and clever
quips, penned by sometime director Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
On the BSU (blow stuff up) meter, it rates an 8. Blast-zone
radius and arching missiles get their due, though the bomb the
villain hankers for is an environmentally correct weapon of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
It's rated PG-13 because violence doesn't rate an R if the
sexuality is "sensuality," the cursing's kept to a minimum, and
there are explosions, but no in-your-face bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
There's a smackdown between Clay and Aisha that's sure to evoke
memories of Brangelina's throwdown in "Mr. and Mrs. Smith."
Grunts, grappling and the Kills' song "U.R.A Fever" lead to a
conflagration and an uneasy mission: Get home. Get Max, the
mysterious CIA liaison that double- crossed Clay and his men.
</P>
<P>
Jason Patric's baddie wears impeccably tailored suits and one
glove. With that accessory and a sociopath's sly delivery, Max
gives off the faint whiff of a Bond villain. It's good to be bad,
very bad. And Patric has nasty fun playing dapper and despicable.
</P>
<P>
"You're not sure how it's going to end, but you're pretty sure
it's going to make the papers," says Max to snaky effect.
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't even have the best lines. Those belong to Evans'
character. Consider Jenson the new IT guy -- as in cute
information-technology fella.
</P>
