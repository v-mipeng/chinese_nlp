Normally in January it is cold;
yesterday and today have been
unseasonably on the warm side.
(low 60's);
Tomorrow is supposed to be cold (mid-30's) again.

This is out my front porch....looks onto the Tijeras Pueblo outside of Albuquerque, NM. Also looks at Cibola National Forest land (elevation 6400 feet). The pueblo is ancient....still buried with some excavation done in the early 1970s. There is a nice, interprative path around it. I do feel the presence of the 'ancient ones' when I am out in my yard! Oh yes, we hear coyotes on the pueblo every night! <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v13/voodoogal/juliesyard3.jpg"/>

bumping up with some wisdom posted on another thread: I don't think its necessary for all the folks who never posted on "The Porch" to repeatedly start new threads... I doubt if Ebay is even paying attention to them. No one from eBay visits the Porch as can be seen by the fact that we have over 106 pages of posts. No other Discussion Board has this many pages of posts that go back as far as the ones left here. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif" alt=":)"/> P.S. I was advised that this fact was brought up at last years "eBay Live" when there were only 75-80 pages of threads! And that it was a glitch that would be fixed. Obviously NO ONE at eBay cares about anyone who posts at The Porch! <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif" alt=":^O"/>

I am in Pasco county, Florida. Actually, I refer to it as "should have Passed Go and not have stopped" florida.The land of Wizard Substitute teachers, unswimmable beaches and the strip clubs and churches pretty much equal each other.

My front porch is my front garden. I have a hidden oasis where we've left the trees to their own devices. They have grown tall and one tree turned out to be a Lime tree when left alone. I have 2 gnomes guarding my small wishing well. Apparently, my oasis is so peaceful that gaggles of Muscovey duck families use it as a hot-sheet motel, which always leads to large families of ducks that also use it to rest. It's not that big, so it kind of smells right now and we have to power wash the concrete where all of these ducks hang around. However, they are really cute. They drink from the pot that my gnome holds as they stretch their feet. My little children have watched them grow quickly from little chicks to almost adults. We have watched how they communicate with each other and the dynamic when the grumpy father duck shows his face and bosses them all around. Ducks bite each others behinds when they need to communicate a strong point, this has been a source for amusement for my kiddos.

FF try this link, I never thought you'se wouldn't use this terminology. what do you call them?? <a href="http://www.modalingerie.com.au/catalogue/category38/product260">http://www.modalingerie.com.au/catalogue/category38/product260</a>. This is what we wear in summer over here with shorts and thongs(flip flops). Gets up around 40 degrees celsius where we are in the sub tropics, that's 104 farinhiet. Suppose to rain today, but it doesn't look like it. Do your weather people get it right most of the time over there?? Ours average about 50-60%.
