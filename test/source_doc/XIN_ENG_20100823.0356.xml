<P>
Taiyuan, capital of west China's Shanxi province, will hold the inaugural
marathon on September 5, becoming the 10th Chinese city to have an international
marathon.
</P>
<P>
Taiyuan, an energy and heavy chemical industry city, aims to build a regional
metropolis with international influence and the marathon is regarded by local
officials as a rare chance to let it known to the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Beijing, the Chinese caiptal, became the first Chinese city to stage an
international marathon.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing marathon organizers claimed that the annual event has grown to
one of the top 10 international marathons in the world, it still struggles to
attract world's best runners like London, Berlin and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
China's other cities, like Shanghai, Xiamen and Dalian, also have ambitious
plans but have to keep their feet on the land when talking about catching up
with London and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
But Taiyuan's officials believed that investing in such an sports event will be
paid off.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jianshe, secretary general of Taiyuan's international marathon committee,
said the Taiyuan International Marathon will play an important role in the
development of a city that is in the midst of a remarkable transformation.
</P>
<P>
"City greening and construction have changed Taiyuan a lot. We will regard this
international sporting event as a chance to show the ancient city a new look to
the world," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Taiyuan International Marathon will be staged along Fenhe River where the
sceneries were awarded "Dubai International Award for Best Practices to Improve
the Living Environment (DIABP)."
</P>
<P>
"International marathon will become an important carrier of mass sports
development," Su Yajun, director of Shanxi provincial bureau of sports, said.
</P>
<P>
Su took Beijing International Marathon as an example. At the very beginning,
only 400 runners took part in the event. In 1998, the figure reached 30,000.
Nowadays, each year over 10,000 runners completed the 42.195 km marathon,
attracting millions of people to watch.
</P>
<P>
The first Taiyuan International Marathon consists of five events: men's and
women's full marathon, men's and women's half marathon, and mini marathon. About
10,000 people are expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that 20 to 30 top foreign athletes, 40 to 50 Chinese
professional athletes, 1,200 Chinese amateur runners, and about 8,000
participants of Mini Marathon.
</P>
<P>
So far, 23 elite foreign runners have been invited to race, including David
Kemboi Murkomer from Kenya who was ranked fifth in 2008 Paris International
Marathon, and Yeshi Esayias Tesemma from Ethiopia who won the women's title in
2010 Daegu International Marathon.
</P>
<P>
In Taiyuan, there are over 100 marathon lovers joining in various national games
all the year around, among which over 20 people attended full marathons for many
times.
</P>
<P>
Sun Gengsheng, a 70-year-old Taiyuan citizen, has run full marathons for 33
times and half marathons for 13 times since he first took part in Beijing
International Marathon in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Ordinary people are the main body of sports. Every time marathon was held, it
was like people were celebrating a festival. I've run marathon for many times in
other cities. Only running in my homeland do I have no regrets," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people and cities are involved in international marathons. They
are attracted by its spirit. And international marathon is becoming city's grand
gathering and people's festival in China," said Shen Chunde, vice chairman of
the Chinese Athletics Association.
