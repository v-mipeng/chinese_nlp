By all accounts, Theodore Roosevelt enjoyed the wildest
post-presidency in American history.
</P>
<P>
Just weeks out of office in 1909, Roosevelt went on an African
safari. Like a king trailing aides and admirers, he bagged nearly
300 antelope, lion, rhino and other big game. In the dozen years
remaining to him, TR then ran for a third term, survived an
assassination attempt, explored an uncharted river, hiked the Grand
Canyon, sent his sons off to World War I and, following an uncanny
prediction about his own longevity, died at age 60.
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt's "strenuous life" has exhausted many a biographer,
but Edmund Morris has proved equal to the task. In the 30 years
since his Pulitzer-winning classic "The Rise of Theodore
Roosevelt," Morris has seen his own star sink and rise again. He
was blasted for making himself a character in his biography of
Ronald Reagan, "Dutch," but rebounded with "Theodore Rex,"
hailed as the best single volume on TR's presidency.
</P>
<P>
Now comes "Colonel Roosevelt," and readers who enjoyed the
first two volumes will dive into this conclusion of Morris' epic
trilogy. Few will be disappointed. Applying a scholar's research, a
biographer's detail and a novelist's phrasing, Morris again brings
Roosevelt to life. And what a life! "I have already lived and
enjoyed as much of life as any nine other men I know," TR wrote in
1914, just before setting out for the Amazon, from which he barely
came back alive.
</P>
<P>
While "Theodore Rex" occasionally bogged down in presidential
politics, "Colonel Roosevelt" is nearly as spry and surprising as
Morris' first volume. Those who think they know Roosevelt -- as
trustbuster, GOP stalwart or just "that damned cowboy" -- will be
stunned by the leftward turn of his post-presidency.
</P>
<P>
In 1912, when he challenged President William Howard Taft,
Roosevelt was attacked for seeking an unprecedented third term. Yet
it was his ultra-progressive platform, advocating a minimum wage,
female suffrage, campaign finance reform and health care for the
poor, that led the press to call him "a socialist," a
"revolutionist" and "a virtual traitor to American
institutions." When the GOP denied him a candidacy he had earned
with a plurality of primary votes, Roosevelt ran on the Bull Moose
ticket, splitting the Republican vote and putting Woodrow Wilson in
the White House. Morris devotes 100 pages to this saga, and it
makes our current political dramas seem small and petty.
</P>
<P>
Though defeated in 1912, Roosevelt continued to write, speak out
and even consider another candidacy. Ever the soldier and former
Rough Rider, in 1915 he also volunteered for a budding war against
Mexico. Yet Morris is at his best when describing Roosevelt's
adventures in jungles other than those of war and politics.
</P>
<P>
Morris' chronicle of TR's disastrous journey through the Amazon
is hair-raising. The story of how Roosevelt, shot in the chest in
1912, rose to deliver his campaign speech, remains awe-inspiring.
"Colonel Roosevelt" also poignantly describes Roosevelt's later
losses, including the death of a son in World War I, and his own
death from a pulmonary embolism in 1919.
</P>
<P>
Morris seems to have read every letter, every memo, every
article by or about his subject. Such mastery enables readers to
see through Roosevelt's wire-rim glasses as he careens across four
continents, down rushing rivers and into the palaces of Europe's
crowned heads.
</P>
<P>
Yet, just as Roosevelt saw the world with one eye -- a boxing
match in the White House blinded his left eye -- Morris
occasionally suffers from tunnel vision. "Colonel Roosevelt" is
sadly lacking in context. While he sketchily outlines World War I,
Morris says nothing about America's tumultuous 1910s, when labor
unrest, radicalism and renegade artists and writers were
challenging timeworn certainties. One will look in vain here for
Roosevelt contemporaries such as John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford,
"Big Bill" Haywood, etc. For Morris, it's all Roosevelt all the
time, and although he dominated his time as few figures before or
since, he would have stood out still more if silhouetted against a
more variegated background.
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by TR, Morris also falls into the biographer's trap
of leaving nothing on the cutting-room floor. Thus he too often
recites lists -- of TR's current reading, of dinner guests, of
forgotten politicos.
</P>
<P>
But these are minor flaws in an otherwise sprawling and splendid
account. While not recommended for the casual reader unfamiliar
with Morris' previous volumes, "Colonel Roosevelt" is a worthy
close to a trilogy sure to be regarded as one of the best studies
not just of any president, but of any American. Upon Roosevelt's
death, the populist editor William Allen White wrote, "The man was
gigantic." So, too, is Morris' trilogy, brought to fruition in
"Colonel Roosevelt."
