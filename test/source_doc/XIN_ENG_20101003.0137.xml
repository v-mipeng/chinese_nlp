<P>
The Kingdom of Belgium, with Brussels as its capital, is a Western European
country bordering the Netherlands to the north, Germany to the east, Luxembourg
to the southeast and France to the south and southwest.
</P>
<P>
Belgium covers an land area of 30,528 square km, plus 3,462 square km of sea
territories and exclusive economic zones. It has a population of approximately
10.677 million, with Dutch, French and German as official languages.
</P>
<P>
Inhabited in ancient times by the Belgae, a Celtic people, the area of Belgium
had been divided and ruled by Romans, Gauls and Teutons for a long time since 57
BC. From the 9th century to 14th century Belgium was broken up into semi-
independent territories.
</P>
<P>
The area was ruled by the Burgundian dynasty during the 14th and 15th centuries,
but was later occupied by Spain, Austria and France. It was incorporated into
the Netherlands in 1815 and declared independence on Oct. 4, 1830. It became a
permanently neutral nation in 1867.
</P>
<P>
Overrun by the Germans in two world wars, Belgium joined NATO after World War
II, and became a member of the European Community in 1958. In 1993 Belgium
became a federation after a national system reform.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is a developed industrial nation that depends heavily on foreign trade.
It imports 80 percent of its raw materials and exports more than 50 percent of
its industrial products. Last year, the country's Gross Domestic Products, or
the GDP, was 334.758 billion U.S dollars, or 43,000 dollars per capita.
</P>
<P>
As a founding member of the European Union and host to EU headquarters, Belgium
actively pursues the acceleration of European integration.
</P>
<P>
It participates in UN peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, while maintaining
a close relationship with the United States and calling for stronger ties with
Russia and Eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Belgium strives to maintain smooth relations with developing countries and
restore traditional influence in Africa by offering development aid. It has
diplomatic ties with about 160 countries and emphasizes economy in diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
China and Belgium established diplomatic relations on Oct. 25, 1971, and
bilateral ties since then have developed very smoothly with frequent high-level
visits.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is now China's seventh biggest trading partner in the EU. Affected by
the global financial crisis, the bilateral trade volume in 2009 dropped to 16.72
billion dollars, down 17.3 percent from 2008. However, in the first quarter of
2010, the bilateral trade volume reached 4.95 billion dollars, up 48.1 percent
year on year.
