POLICE-SHOOTING-GA -- ATLANTA -- Four years after rogue
narcotics officers killed a 92-year-old woman while illegally
raiding her home, the city of Atlanta has finally settled with her
family. Mayor Kasim Reed announced Monday that the estate of
Kathryn Johnston, led by her niece Sarah Dozier, would be getting a
$4.9 million settlement. (Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

DEFLATION -- ATLANTA -- A specter is haunting your investment --
the specter of deflation. Only a fleeting fear six years ago, worry
of an economy-wide slide in prices has returned, slipping into
economists' discussions and shading investment decisions. There is
no consensus -- just pressure to make the right call at a time when
the stakes are high and the rules have changed. (Kanell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

DELTA-UNIONS -- ATLANTA -- As Delta Air Lines workers prepare to
vote in massive union representation elections later this year,
labor leaders say wins at the company could influence organizing
around the South. "Delta is an icon in Atlanta," said Patrick
Scott, who works with the AFL-CIO-organized ATL Solidarity
Committee, a coalition to support union efforts. The Delta
elections will "set the tone" for other unionization campaigns,
he said. (Yamanouchi, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

DUVALL-GET-LOW -- AUSTIN, Texas -- To land the actor he wanted
to play a shadowy old hermit in "Get Low," director Aaron
Schneider had to work up his nerve and head out to the country to
meet a real-life character, Robert Duvall. (Eaton, Austin

OUTDOORS-LEGGETT -- AUSTIN, Texas -- When I was a kid in East
Texas, dove hunting was an afterthought, just a bridge that got us
over September and into October when we could hunt squirrels. There
were never many doves just enough to kill a few in an afternoon.
Today doves are hunted all over Texas. There are plenty of them. It
doesn't cost much. And, compared to other forms of hunting, it is
accessible to young, old and, often, the disabled. (Leggett, Austin
American-Statesman)
