A series of strong earthquakes hit a mountainous and impoverished area of
China's Qinghai province early Wednesday, killing 589 people and injuring over
ten thousand.

The Yao Ming Foundation and U.S. company iTalkBB quickly responded to this
disaster by providing a free hotline for the overseas Chinese to contact their
friends and relatives in Qinghai.

"My foundation is determining how we can best help. We are pleased to be able to
collaborate with iTalkBB on this free hotline to help relatives of the victims,"
said Yao.

The Yao Ming Foundation has accumulated some experience from its aid to the
earthquake-stricken areas in Sichuan province, and such kind of experience will
help the foundation do a better job this time, Yao said.

The Yao Ming Foundation, established in 2008, has donated around 2 million
dollars to Sichuan, which was hit by a magnitude-8.0 tremor on May 12, 2008.
Some 80,000 people died and more than 8,000 school rooms were destroyed in the
disaster.
