Shaquille O'Neal is competing far outside his weight class in the second season of "Shaq Vs."
</P>
<P>
ABC announced Wednesday that Justin Bieber is among those the basketball star will face off with in his reality competition series. O'Neal will visit the much smaller 16-year-old pop star and join in a dance crew competition.
</P>
<P>
The second season of "Shaq Vs." will take the focus off athletic competitions. O'Neal will have a cook-off with Rachael Ray and a hot-dog-eating contest with competitive eating champion Joey Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
He will also race Dale Earnhardt Jr., try magic with Penn &amp; Teller and box Sugar Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal says: "I'm out to prove that I can compete beyond athletics. ... There's no challenge bigger than me."
</P>
<P>
The second season premieres Aug. 3.
