Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a man should beware
of in the three stages of his life. In youth, when the constitution of his body
is not yet formed, he should beware of lust. In manhood, when his physical
powers are in full vigor, he should beware of strife. In old age, when the
physical powers are in decay, he should beware of greed."
