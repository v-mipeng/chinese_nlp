Bruce Lee's older sister and younger brother have authorized a Chinese company to make a series of biographical films about the late kung fu icon, saying they want to produce a historically accurate account of their brother's life.
</P>
<P>
Phoebe Lee and Robert Lee appeared at a signing ceremony with J.A. Media in Beijing on Monday, 36 years to the day after Bruce Lee died in Hong Kong at age 32 from swelling of the brain.

<P>
Lee became a source of Chinese pride by portraying characters who defended the Chinese and the working class from oppressors in films like "Return of the Dragon."
</P>
<P>
It wasn't immediately clear who will play Lee in the film series.
</P>
<P>
Producer Manfred Wong said the company plans at least three installments, with the first to tackle Lee's teenage years, adding he wanted to focus more on the late actor's personality.

"There will be kung fu ... But more importantly, we want to portray the real Bruce Lee. What is the real Bruce Lee like? He was very humorous. He was very obedient to his parents. He was very kind to his family," Wong said, according to footage of the ceremony on the Chinese news Web site Sina.com.

<P>
Robert Lee said he wanted to give an authoritative account of his brother's life.
</P>
<P>
"We've read many books and seen many movies about Bruce Lee, but there are many inaccuracies in them. They made up things," he said, without referring to specific works or factual mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more than 70 years old. I'm old. I want do something for my younger brother -- to promote Bruce Lee's life story," Phoebe Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV aired a 50-part prime-time series about Lee last year.
</P>
<P>
Wong did not say how much the movies will cost. Calls to the company Tuesday seeking more detail went unanswered.
