A university term paper checking system was developed in China by its second
largest computer producer after Lenovo, TsinghuaTongfang, to prevent plagiarism
among college students, Beijing-based China Youth Daily reported Thursday.

The Paper Misconduct Literature Check System (PMLC) is capable of checking
students' term papers, course work, experimental and investigation reports to
find similarities among students' works, Sun Xiongyong, an expert from Tsinghua
Tongfang, was quoted as saying.

Besides checking students'  papers, the system has a credit database to record
students' misconduct in plagiarism. There is also an archive of students' papers
to prevent their being copied from each other, Sun said.

<P>
The creation of the PMLC was due to the requirement of many universities who
believe plagiarism among students was "quite common". So far, 88 Chinese
universities have signed agreements with the company to  use the PMLC, Sun said.

A recently finished survey, which was conducted by the East China Normal
University on college students' online behavior, showed that about 57% of
respondents admitted they have copied research from online resources at least
once.
