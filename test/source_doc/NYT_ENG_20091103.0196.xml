CHILDREN ' S HOSPITAL, 3 HEALTH PLANS PUSH COST-CONTROL EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children's Hospital Boston has agreed to limit increases in fees it
charges
the state's major health insurers next year as part of a larger
push to
control the rise in pediatric health care costs.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the three health plans - Blue Cross-Blue Shield,
Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care, and Tufts Health Plan - along with the state's
Medicaid program, will contribute a portion of their savings, about
$10
million in total, to a fund that will enable Children's Hospital to
accelerate pilot programs aimed at providing better care at lower
costs.
</P>
<P>
One program gives doctors immediate feedback on the success of
treatments.
Another explores ways to expand the range of services provided by
primary
care physicians, potentially enabling them to handle ailments like
headaches and asthma without having to refer patients to
specialists. A
third is pioneering new payment models for pediatric care as state
lawmakers consider revamping the current payment system.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to look at the efficiency of these kind of
services that
are delivered to patients," said Children's Hospital's president,
Sandra
L. Fenwick. "Hopefully, over time we'll be developing not only
lower-cost
health care, but also health care of the same quality or higher
quality."
</P>
<P>
Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice president at Boston-based Blue
Cross and
Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state's largest health insurer,
said the
Children's Hospital arrangement is the first in Massachusetts in
which a
hospital and its physicians voluntarily agreed to reduce fees and
target
some of the savings to boost effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
"The Holy Grail that everyone's been after is how do we lower
costs and
improve care at the same time," Dreyfus said. "This gives us a
great
opportunity to try to do that in a pediatric setting."
</P>
<P>
Children's Hospital, which hosts the world's largest research
operation
based at a pediatric center, has begun funding some of the pilot
programs
on its own over the past 18 months and will still contribute to
what it
calls a "collaborative clinical effectiveness fund."
</P>
<P>
The hospital also will be forming a 10-member advisory committee
for the
pilot programs, consisting of representatives of each of the health
insurers and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human
Services,
which oversees the state's Medicaid program, along with the
hospital and
its physicians group. "If we can get everyone to the table, we can
harness
all of their expertise," Fenwick said.
</P>
<P>
Forming a partnership between a hospital, its doctors, and a
consortium
of
payers is a novel approach to controlling costs, said Marc A. Bard,
managing director of Navigant Consulting in Needham, who has
advised
Children's and other hospitals on health care issues.
</P>
<P>
"This is quite innovative," Bard said. "What they're looking
at is
making the fundamental trade-off that up to now hasn't been made:
investing
in prevention of illness on the front end to save money on the back
end.
There is now ample evidence that paying for the better coordination
of
care
up front will reduce the need for hospitalization."
</P>
<P>
Fenwick said hospital officials approached the health plans over
the
summer to propose the plan. Under the arrangement, the hospital
will curb
its rate of fee increases for doctor visits, tests, and surgical
procedures
between 50 and 75 percent during the coming year. The precise
amount
varies
across categories of care, insurance plans, and insurers, each of
which
has
its own contracts with Children's.
