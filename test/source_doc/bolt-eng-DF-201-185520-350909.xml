What are those red bars representing. Are you implying there was a previous president and an administration, and that economy was doing certain things, prior to Obama being elected to office?

I'm only asking because--implicitly--I've been told otherwise.

I wouldn't mind this so much if it were explained how the current economic good news was the result of trampling the Constitution. When Bush enacted policies that directly infringed on rights like due process I got how that was trampling on the Constitution. Obama?

Well, I'm glad there's someone getting ahead during this recession. What I'm hearing is that the jobs we're getting aren't the higher paying ones, but closer to minimum wage. This might not be so bad if this is working out as an economic correction; it will eventually balance out, and some overpaying gigs will be settling in where they ought to.

What I'm seeing is a lot of homes still in foreclosure, and a lot of folks out of work. I see a lot of folks out with their hands out on the street corner.

I don't trust the stats. Not yet, anyway. Show me how these figures came about, how old they are, and what the criteria for them are.

Depends what paper you're looking at. Our growth is still too slow to make up for the drop:

<img src="http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/runningbehinid.jpg"/>

And the drop in the unemployment figures is in large part due to discouraged workers. The labor force participation rate is still really low:

Graphs of the monthly change make it look like we're doing good, but 1) population growth means you need to add jobs just to stand still, and 2) graphs of the total change... don't look so good.

Conceded. We've yet to deal with inequality. Policies, particularly tax policies, favor the rich by far. Each year health care costs grow faster than inflation while income is stagnant.

And of course the GOP candidate won't be campaigning on proposals designed to address economic inequity.

All their proposals still hope to stimulate the economy by cutting taxes on the "job creators" and further shrinking government (the largest source of job losses).

Sure, the problem is that they are kind of connected.

The classic idea of capitalism is that although the pie is unevenly distributed it is but big enough for all to live comfortably.
What you are seeing now* is that it is growing, but the unevenness in distribution is growing faster. In fact this depression thingie is not really a problem for the 0.1% as their share and total income is still growing.

*And for the last 30 years or so.

The problem then is that the poor aren't doing better, not that the rich are. And there are plenty of actions one could take which would hurt the rich, but wouldn't actually help the poor. That might lower inequality, but nobody would be better off, and so such actions would be a mistake. That's why I think it's a problem to talk in terms of inequality rather than in terms of making things better for the poor.

That disconnect was made rather glaring when Obama said he would raise capital gains tax even if it decreased revenue, for the sake of fairness. Now, there's a whole big argument about whether or not raising capital gains tax would raise or lower revenue, but that debate is irrelevant: the question was if raising the tax would lower revenue, would he do it. He said he would. And that's just plain crazy, because even if it's more "fair", it would still hurt the poor. The only way taxing the rich can help the poor is if that revenue can be used in a way which benefits them. That could be through government services, infrastructure which helps the economy in general, offsets which allow their own tax burden to be decreased, whatever. So a tax rate increase which lowered revenue would hurt the poor even if it reduced inequality. But just raising taxes on the rich for the sake of fairness? That doesn't help anyone.

Again, the problem isn't inequality. It's that the poor are suffering economically. If you want to argue that taxes should be raised on the rich in order to help the poor, then you've got to be able to argue that increase in taxes can directly help the poor. And decreasing inequality doesn't actually help them.

Actually, it is.

The problem with the constant bleat of class politics is that it ignores the reality of what happens to the rest of us. How the hell does it improve my life if the rich pay more or less in taxes? (And skip the crap about how lowering the taxes of the "job providers" makes it more likely I'll work. Most of the time, they start looking for ways to ship these jobs overseas, so I'm not buying it.) If the poor aren't seeing a genuine improvement in their lives, what difference does it make?

I've been poor the better part of my life. Most of the proposals which were supposed to improve my life did precisely the opposite, and wound up costing more than they were promoted. The reason for such programs being established had far less to do with helping people like me than it did rewarding political contributors and PACs. It's more than a little insulting to listen to the politicians going on about how much they've helped the little guy when -- as a little guy -- I keep getting screwed over by the very same programs that were supposed to be doing me so much good.

Sure. I'd call it bullfeathers, but there's another substance that seems to be far more applicable.

Obama did not create the disaster which has buried us, but rather than taking a more circumspect view of this, he's dug us in deeper, and the Republicans are correct in pointing this out. What they're not doing (and this is why they will LOSE this November) is making reasoned and rational proposals to change direction. Much of what's being offered is the same sort of crap they've put forth before. It's John McCain all over again, suggesting that one way we can help the poor get health insurance is to offer tax credits.

Right. That's smart as hell. You have people who can't afford the premiums in the first place, but you'll offer them credit on their taxes when they get health insurance. (Note to Senator John: This is why people think you're stupid.)

Mother Jones and other publications are quick -- correctly so -- to point out Republican stupidity. The "improvements" we're seeing under Obama, however, are nothing to start cheering over. When one of the requirements coming for Truckers is getting your TWIC card so you can go into the ports and haul out containerized freight coming from Asia to be sold in WalMarts across the nation in lieu of all those products which were supposed to have been manufactured in the US. Frankly, I'd be happy to see the whole tax issue set aside if anyone would actually offer thoughtful proposals on how to get this country working again.

And if you're going to do that, skip this crap about college degrees. Much of the work that needs to be done in this country doesn't require them, and it's pandering to the damned classists who got us into this mess in the first place. I've lost track of the educated idiots who seem to think spending four years in an institution of higher learning gives them the right to violate the laws of physics and common sense, not to mention the insipid idea that this somehow makes them superior to the rest of us, and exempt from what most of us learned was basic decency. (No, I will not discuss it, god damn it.)

No, Obama didn't create the mess. But he's spending us further into debt, and I've yet to see how it's supposed to pay off in the eternal run, much less the long or short run. But the Republicans aren't offering anything other than making it plain that they aren't Obama.

They're right. I don't think any one of them gives a rat's ass about the voter's they're trying to win over. And they'll give even less of one if, by chance, any one of them gets into office.

They aren't Obama. Obama at least tries to do what's right. I think he's wrong, but props for at least taking a shot at it.

Yes, that is the classic argument on share of the pie vs. size of the pie.
The argument is sound enough if supported by facts.
(I have no problem with e.g. Mr. Mærsk being a billionaire if he creates jobs and income for a huge number of others.)

I happen to get my economic information from <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">Paul Krugmans page on the NYTimes</a> which I find to in synch with reality.

It does not support the idea of the 0.1% being able to continue increasing their huge share of the shrinking or levelling pie without somebody else loosing out big time.

I happen to get my economic information from <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">Paul Krugmans page on the NYTimes</a> which I find to in synch with reality.

</quote>
Krugman has been wrong plenty of times. He can be interesting when he confines himself to economics, but he doesn't exactly bring academic rigor to his politics.

<quote>
It does not support the idea of the 0.1% being able to continue increasing their huge share of the shrinking or levelling pie without somebody else loosing out big time.

</quote>
But what you're talking about isn't just inequality. You're claiming that the rich have gotten rich at the expense of the poor. But in general, the only "evidence" I see to support this is inequality itself, which doesn't actually prove the point.

Furthermore, what's at issue here isn't whether or not the current state of affairs satisfies you, but what to do. And even if you're right that the very rich have gotten richer at the expense of others, that doesn't provide an answer. You can feel that they've wronged society as much as you want to, and deserve some economic payback, but if that payback also hurts the poor, then it's obviously the wrong thing to do. We're STILL left with the question of what to do to help the poor. And maybe you'll still conclude that taxing the rich more will accomplish that. But until you start examining the question in terms of what will help the poor, rather than what will reduce inequality, you run the risk of making things worse.

I suspect that hard economic times make it easier to increase the inequality in society and that it can give a faster growth in absolute wealth of the 0.1% than regular growth in society's wealth.

So it the pie shrink slower than your share of it is increasing you are getting richer.

Ziggurat,
As for Krugman there are several faiths within economics, I guess you subscribe to some of the right wing ones.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth">Distribution of wealth</a>

According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office">Congressional Budget Office</a>, between 1979 and 2007 incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. During the same time period, the 60% of Americans in the middle of the income scale saw their income rise by 40%. Since 1979 the average pre-tax income for the bottom 90% of households has decreased by $900, while that of the top 1% increased by over $700,000, as federal taxation became less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax">progressive</a>. From 1992-2007 the top 400 income earners in the U.S. saw their income increase 392% and their average tax rate reduced by 37%. In 2009, the average income of the top 1% was $960,000 with a minimum income of $343,927.

In 2007 the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%. Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%. Financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.However, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession">Great Recession</a> which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 34.6% to 37.1%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 85% to 87.7%. The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36.1% in median household wealth but a drop of only 11.1% for the top 1%, further widening the gap between the 1% and the 99%. During the economic expansion between 2002 and 2007, the income of the top 1% grew 10 times faster than the income of the bottom 90%. In this period 66% of total income gains went to the 1%, who in 2007 had a larger share of total income than at any time since 1928

That disconnect was made rather glaring when Obama said he would raise capital gains tax even if it decreased revenue, for the sake of fairness. Now, there's a whole big argument about whether or not raising capital gains tax would raise or lower revenue, but that debate is irrelevant: the question was if raising the tax would lower revenue, would he do it. He said he would. And that's just plain crazy, because even if it's more "fair", it would still hurt the poor. The only way taxing the rich can help the poor is if that revenue can be used in a way which benefits them. That could be through government services, infrastructure which helps the economy in general, offsets which allow their own tax burden to be decreased, whatever. So a tax rate increase which lowered revenue would hurt the poor even if it reduced inequality. But just raising taxes on the rich for the sake of fairness? That doesn't help anyone.

Actually, it is.

The problem with the constant bleat of class politics is that it ignores the reality of what happens to the rest of us. How the hell does it improve my life if the rich pay more or less in taxes? (And skip the crap about how lowering the taxes of the "job providers" makes it more likely I'll work. Most of the time, they start looking for ways to ship these jobs overseas, so I'm not buying it.) If the poor aren't seeing a genuine improvement in their lives, what difference does it make?

</quote>
The problem is this. People with money aren't doing the things they used to do with money. The "job-creators" aren't creating jobs, and the "lending institutions" aren't lending.

In 1999, I was working in Boca Raton. There was one restaurant I used to go to a lot. It was a fun place, well decorated, with cheerful employees. It was built entirely as a tax break. People with money didn't like paying high taxes, and so they did things to make themselves pay less taxes.

Over the past decade, the push was to give those with a lot of money lower taxes without their having to do anything. The alibi was that monied people were just fantastic people who would continue to build restaurants. Unsurprisingly, they didn't. There was no incentive to build restaurants and the like, so they didn't. They liked not having to do those things, because they'd rather not hire lawyers, accountants, construction workers, and waiters.

And why should they? If the economy is depressed, employees are cheaper. If there are foreclosures, they you can buy them cheaper. It's like having more money without the number of dollars getting bigger. Are they going to give up these advantages for the public good? Hardly. Even Alan Greenspan admitted that the idea that the monied were just great people who were interested in keeping the game fair was wrong.

Of course, we could raise there taxes to give them incentives to do things to lower their tax burden again, with improving the economy as a side-effect. They understand this. That's how money is made, and how they got their money in the first place. But given that they have the money, it's better for them to have everything else go to pot, because it makes the things they grudgingly pay money for (like land and workers) a lot cheaper. It's completely rational. This is by no means a failure of the economy. It's a fantastic deal if you have money.

They know that the economy isn't a zero-sum game for them. They got the money when it was flowing freely, in and out, and they collected some from the flow. The more the money flows, the easier it is to get. When the economy is growing, it's as if there's more and more money, especially with tricks like fractional reserve banking. Whether there actually is more money or not is a semantic parlor game. It's like the laws of thermodynamics, where the flow of heat is how you get useful energy, which is more important than the abstract concept of total energy.

But once you have deep pockets, zero-sum becomes attractive. First, when you have a lot, the formerly desirable flow becomes undesirable, because you get worried about flow out. Fortunately, once the economy gets bad enough, the flow out due to savings accounts and 401k's and things like that stops because they run out. If you still have money, you win.

This wouldn't work as easily if people figured it out. So you have to convince people that the economy really is a zero-sum game. Again, fortunately, for most people it is a zero-sum game or, especially if the economy is bad, a negative-sum game. It isn't difficult, because people naturally go into zero-sum mode when things are bad, but there is some art to it.

Formerly, you talked about a high tide raising all boats, trickle-down economics, and investment. Now, you talk about spending, the evils of socialism, and stealing. And then a miracle happens, because once people start thinking in terms of a zero-sum or negative-sum game, they don't stop. You start to get allies amongst the poor, though you never let on that they are helping you. This is easy, because if you don't want to lose what you have, they certainly don't want to lose what little they have. Even your ideological opponents will help. They will mock the idea of spending to improve the economy, and thus keep money flow down to a minimum. Even real socialists can be co-opted. The last thing a critic of capitalism wants to see is people prospering under it.

It's quite brilliant. Totally rational, resulting from individual self-interest, with no need for a conspiracy at all. Rich and poor, right and left, all working together to make things suck.

</quote>
401(k)'s aren't subject to capital gains tax, they're subject to income tax.

But more broadly, we should be encouraging everyone to invest money, and not just for retirement. If someone of modest income wants to invest in order to move up the economic ladder during their working career, then they can't do that with a 401(k). They need to make taxable investments, and that will be subject to capital gains rates.

The argument for increasing tax rates on capital gains is that it's mostly paid for by the rich, and they can afford it. But it's not that simple. Taxing anything will reduce the amount of it. But not everything has the same elasticity. Almost everyone has to work, but not everyone has to invest, or invest all their money. So investment is more elastic than labor. It might be "fair" to increase the capital gains tax rate, and the rich may be able to afford it, and you could even exempt the poor and middle class from it. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily a good idea. The poor suffer when the rich don't invest.

Whether or not the tax system favors them, the economic system surely favors them by a great margin.

What I'm seeing is a lot of homes still in foreclosure, and a lot of folks out of work. I see a lot of folks out with their hands out on the street corner.
