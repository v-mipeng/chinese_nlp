<quote>
GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said today that Americans "fear the rise of the Soviet Union" during an appearance on a conservative radio talk show.

The Soviet Union broke up into 15 separate republics 20 years ago. Boris Yeltsin was the first freely elected leader of Russia, the largest of those republics.

"What people recognize is that there's a fear that the United States is in an unstoppable decline. They see the rise of China, the rise of India, the rise of the Soviet Union and our loss militarily going forward," Bachmann said on Jay Sekulow's radio show.

It's kind of hypocritical to start a thread on a "flub" and then whine when reminded of other "flubs"...

Humans flub... Humans remind others of other people's flubbs, as you did in the OP and as CG did above...

No need to whine about it, though...

Again, those were flubs already made. There have been threads acknowledging them. What I find very interesting is the same people who laughed at President Obama's 57 state flub and Joe Biden's FDR flub refuse to even dare criticize or laugh at Bachmann's.

I'm not referring to you. I know how you feel about Bachmann. My point was that the President Obama flub was made back in May of 2008. Every single time a Republican makes a error and a thread is made about it, that comment is brought up.

And yet if President Obama made a flub today or tomorrow, those same people would laugh about those while defending Bachmann for hers. Simple as that.

Like I said, if President Obama makes a flub tomorrow, I expect many of the same people who constantly bring up the 57 states comment to criticize the President or laugh at him. However, they will defend Bachmann and others under the pretense of "everyone makes mistakes."

I have neither the desire nor need to "defend" Bachmann. Your attack was mindless hackery. Rather than consider or deal with the substance of what she claimed, you launched into the standard "She stoopud" routine that partisan hacks of the left use in all situations.

Russia HAS risen from the ashes of the old USSR, Putin DOES openly speak of once again taking the stage a superpower. Putin HAS established himself as a Soviet era strongman.

Your attack was mindless, driven by your partisanship - you never considered her claim, because you don't care - she is of the enemy party, to be savaged at all costs.

It's just what you do.

Though to set the record straight, I wasn't whining about it. But nothing I say at this point will settle that argument. So no point in really further arguing it.

On top of that, the article doesn't reference the resurgence of the Soviet Empire at all. In fact, the article describes many of the problems that Russia currently has.

In fact, the closing line of the article is this:

She's been in politics less time than Obama. She's never run a business, that business that she co-owned with her husband was run by him.

<quote>
GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said today that Americans "fear the rise of the Soviet Union" during an appearance on a conservative radio talk show.

The Soviet Union broke up into 15 separate republics 20 years ago. Boris Yeltsin was the first freely elected leader of Russia, the largest of those republics.

"What people recognize is that there's a fear that the United States is in an unstoppable decline. They see the rise of China, the rise of India, the rise of the Soviet Union and our loss militarily going forward," Bachmann said on Jay Sekulow's radio show.

I'd say that most Americans fear the rise of the Tea Party... because let's see, you can't be a progressive(they're the enemy), you can't be a Moderate(they're just the enemy in sheep's clothing), you can't be a libertarian(because they're weird), you can't be a poor(fucking tics on the ass of society), you can't be gay(they're an abomination), you CAN be of a different race(Officially... Unofficially? not so much).

LOL! Well you see, here's the deal: While Obama was spending $200M a day in India, making sure that only one drilling permit was granted all year so that gay people could be cured with prayer, the Founding Fathers abolished Russian slavery on Elvis' birthday!

The woman just can't help but have the stupid come falling out every times she opens her mouth!

This post brought to you by someone who has posted Biden gaffes, started threads about how Obama sucks as a president, Obamacare is evil, unions are evil, and named at least two Conservative Women he would support as presidential candidates. In other words, the whackjobs will now claim I'm a "Liberal who just hates strong conservative women" <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> (Someday they'll understand: It's not the woman part, not the Conservative part - it's the stupid...)

<quote>
GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said today that Americans "fear the rise of the Soviet Union" during an appearance on a conservative radio talk show.

The Soviet Union broke up into 15 separate republics 20 years ago. Boris Yeltsin was the first freely elected leader of Russia, the largest of those republics.

"What people recognize is that there's a fear that the United States is in an unstoppable decline. They see the rise of China, the rise of India, the rise of the Soviet Union and our loss militarily going forward," Bachmann said on Jay Sekulow's radio show.

Clearly her ignorance and stupidity are infinite.

Or:

Shes showing her contempt for the American people by trying to exploit their fear.

Either way yet more compelling evidence as to her being unfit to serve as president.

Note I'm not referring to a 'flub,' rather the idiocy and ignorance exhibited by the statement in full.

</quote>

I get a list of all his flubs, want to try that one on me? Did you know he recently told automakers need to understand the market and make smaller cars like the Volt, which sold a whopping 125 units last month?

That he called the host of his town hall meeting in Michigan the Waffle Hybrid Company? The actual name is the Wyffle Hybrids, and that it was in plain view all over the room?

How about the fact that he deliberately misrepresented what Qaddafi said in his speech telling his supporters that he would rout out the rebels if they refused to surrender, yet allowed Assad 6 months to attack his people, and sat by while the Syrian Navy attacked the largest Palestinian community in that country.

The man flubs every time he does anything. I could easily start a new thread every single day about Obama flubs, but I mostly leave them alone because I actually accept that people make mistakes when they talk, and that they even make mistakes in policy.

You, on the other hand, like to point out the flubs of people who actually make Obama look bad. Do you think that you might be trying to compensate for his obvious shortcomings not only as a politician, but as a human being?

You're right, everyone mis-speaks (love that expression) - but hang on...she's claiming to know what Americans are concerned about.
Is it true that they are concerned about the rise of a power that doesn't exist, or has she just made that up?
Are all Americans as ignorant as her about global politics?
Does that put her other statements into doubt?
Does she actually research any of her statements?
Can you believe any claim that she makes?

It's kind of hypocritical to start a thread on a "flub" and then whine when reminded of other "flubs"...

Humans flub... Humans remind others of other people's flubbs, as you did in the OP and as CG did above...

No need to whine about it, though...

For some reason if President Obama had made another flub, I doubt you would be making such a post. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_think.gif"/>

<quote>
GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said today that Americans "fear the rise of the Soviet Union" during an appearance on a conservative radio talk show.

The Soviet Union broke up into 15 separate republics 20 years ago. Boris Yeltsin was the first freely elected leader of Russia, the largest of those republics.

"What people recognize is that there's a fear that the United States is in an unstoppable decline. They see the rise of China, the rise of India, the rise of the Soviet Union and our loss militarily going forward," Bachmann said on Jay Sekulow's radio show.

The Russians are rebuilding rather quickly...

It's only a matter of time before they attempt to reclaim what their collapse liberated.

When Russia attempts to do that without question progressives will side with the Russians.

Progressives defended the Russians when they went into Georgia and they'll do so when they attempt to reclaim the block.

Afghanistan bankrupted the USSR. The communists spent more than they could generate and as a welfare state that bankrupted them - kinda sounds like our present US government..

You have to remember that the purpose of the communist model is to sustain - not generate wealth - only few in the model (the elitists) have that opportunity.

First you call someone else a "naive Obama drone" as if they are stupid for laughing at Whackmann's colossally stupid remark. Okay, that was only mildly funny. But then, like a good little Whackmann defender, you try to defend The Stupid! LOL!
When was the last time you lived in a former Soviet Country? Lemme guess. Never! Obviously! Your ignorance on this is like a billboard. So like a good little drone, you just pull sh1t outta your @ss to try to defend what she said. You believe Putin is going to convince Latvia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan etc... to rejoin a new Soviet Union? Or launch a military invasion to rebuild it? And you imply someone else is stupid because they don't buy into that absolute bullsh1t???? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

2. Claims illegal immigrants are one of the biggest factors to all of America's crime and unemployment problems?
3. Wants a "Papers Please" law like AZ's in place and the requirement of a BC for voting?
4. Calls for less gun control and declares those seeking more are Anti-Constitutionalists?
5. Calls for the removal of Affirmative Action?
6. States the CRA of '64 is UnConstitutional?
7. Finds the "sanctity of life" overrides the governments authority to allow abortions but not the death penalty?
8. Want to eliminate the use of any languge but English in American public schools?
9. Are against gay rights, gay marriage and gays serving in the military?
10. Have leaders who believe that homosexuality is a perversion or disease?
11. Want the elimination of "Hate Crimes"?

Well with ALL those political stances, it could only be one party, right? Two? Three? These are the stated positions of both the American Nazi Party and the American Socialist Party (another American Nazi group).

Guess which one of us can prove what we're saying and which one of us is completely full of sh1t? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Ever notice how it's just a mistake when a Lib says something stupid, but when a con does the same it's some how a clear sign that they are brain dead.

<quote>
GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said today that Americans "fear the rise of the Soviet Union" during an appearance on a conservative radio talk show.

The Soviet Union broke up into 15 separate republics 20 years ago. Boris Yeltsin was the first freely elected leader of Russia, the largest of those republics.

"What people recognize is that there's a fear that the United States is in an unstoppable decline. They see the rise of China, the rise of India, the rise of the Soviet Union and our loss militarily going forward," Bachmann said on Jay Sekulow's radio show.

Being a conservative myself--I think the Soviet Union--really does NOT pose a threat to the United States--we are NOT living in the 50's and 60's anymore. Russians have had enough --like Americans with the cold war--and would be very reluctant to enter another 40 year cold war.

Bachmann goes way to far for me--she blew it also with her I promise you gasoline will drop under $2.00 per gallon. Just ridiculous statements--showing she really doesn't have a basis for energy or foreign policy for that matter. She's toast.
