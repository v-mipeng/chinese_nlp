China's first underground inter- city metro line, the Guangzhou-Foshan Metro
Line (GFML) in south China's Guangdong Province, kicked off a trial run
Thursday, said an official of Guangzhou Metro Corporation(GMC).
</P>
<P>
The 21-kilometer line, connecting Foshan City and the provincial capital
Guangzhou, has 14 stations including -- 11 in Foshan and three in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The line will officially start operating on November 3, nine days before the
16th Asian Games in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the Asian Games venues will be accessible by metro lines
and inter-city tracks between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Passengers will be able to change the metro line between two cities without
changing their tickets, as the GFML will be connected with Guangzhou's metro
network. Public transport tickets from both Guangzhou and Foshan will be
accepted on the metro line.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60,000 free tickets were distributed to local residents Thursday to
encourage them to experience the new railway line.

"It used to take more than one hour from Foshan to Guangzhou by bus and cost me
ten yuan (about 1.5 U.S. dollars). Now it will take only half an hour and cost
me six yuan," said Rong Guobao, a resident in Foshan.
</P>
<P>
"The new line feels smoother and more comfortable than other metro lines. Its
design is more passenger-oriented. It will be much more convenient for me to
travel to Foshan," a passenger surnamed Chen said.
