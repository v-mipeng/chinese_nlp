Statement posted by Tiger Woods on his website on Tuesday, announcing he would
make his return to competitive golf after a break of nearly five months at the
Masters next month in Augusta, Georgia:
</P>
<P>
"The Masters is where I won my first major, and I view this tournament with
great respect. After a long and necessary time away from the game, I feel like
I'm ready to start my season at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
"The major championships have always been a special focus in my career and, as a
professional, I think Augusta is where I need to be, even though it's been
awhile since I last played.
</P>
<P>
"I have undergone almost two months of inpatient therapy and I am continuing my
treatment. Although I'm returning to competition, I still have a lot of work to
do in my personal life.
</P>
<P>
"When I finally got into a position to think about competitive golf again, it
became apparent to me that the Masters would be the earliest I could play. I
called both Joe Lewis and Arnold Palmer and expressed my regrets for not
attending the Tavistock Cup and the Arnold Palmer Invitational. I again want to
thank them both for their support and their understanding. Those are fantastic
tournaments, and I look forward to competing in them again.
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to thank the Augusta National members and staff for their
support. I have deep appreciation for everything that they do to create a
wonderful event for the benefit of the game."
