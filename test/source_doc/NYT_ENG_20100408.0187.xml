SOCK-LESS COUPLES PUTS BEST FOOT FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUGUSTA, Ga.--Exactly six months earlier, Fred Couples wandered
Harding Park in a ceremonial role as U.S. captain in the Presidents
Cup. Thursday night, he went to sleep in sole possession of the
lead at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
Nice transformation.
</P>
<P>
Couples--at age 50 and wearing tennis shoes with no socks
because they help his troublesome back--shot an opening-round 66.
It was the best Masters round of his long career, and it gave him a
one-shot lead over Tom Watson, Phil Mickelson and three other
players.
</P>
<P>
So maybe success on the Champions Tour, where Couples won his
past three starts, does translate to Augusta National. Couples did
not sound especially confident earlier this week, saying it would
be a "pipe dream" to think he can duplicate his 1992 title.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, to win Augusta at age 50 would be a pipe dream,"
Couples said after needing only 24 putts Thursday. "Can I still
win? Of course. It would be a nice dream, for sure, but I've got a
lot of golf left to even think about being in contention."

TIGER ON COMMERCIAL: Tiger Woods spoke for the first time about
the television advertisement Nike released on the eve of this
Masters. In the commercial, a solemn-looking Woods stares straight
ahead while the voice of his late father, Earl, asks "Did you
learn anything?"
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how my dad can speak to me in different ways,
even when he's long gone," Woods said. "He's still helping me.
Any son who has lost a father, who meant so much in their life, I
think they would understand the spot."
</P>
<P>
BRIEFLY: Mickelson went eagle-birdie-birdies at Nos. 13 through
15 to shoot his 67. ... Y.E. Yang, playing in his first major since
he took down Woods in last year's PGA Championship, also shot 67.
... Thanks mostly to friendly pin positions, 16 players posted
scores in the 60s and no fewer than 31 broke par. ... On the other
end of the spectrum, Jim Furyk and Henrik Stenson each shot 80.
