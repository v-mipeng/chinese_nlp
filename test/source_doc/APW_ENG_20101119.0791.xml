The Canadian military says it has taken what may be an unprecedented step by burning the uniforms of former colonel Russell Williams who was convicted of murder and sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Hubert Genest said Friday that Williams's clothes were burned the previous day at CFB Trenton -- Canada's largest military airbase which Williams once commanded.
</P>
<P>
Williams was sentenced last month to life in prison after pleading guilty to murdering two women and raping two others.
</P>
<P>
Genest says uniforms are usually retrieved when someone leaves the military. He says Williams' clothing was burned because much of it had his name on it.
</P>
<P>
Williams was once a rising star in the military who flew prime ministers and served as a pilot to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during a 2005 visit.
