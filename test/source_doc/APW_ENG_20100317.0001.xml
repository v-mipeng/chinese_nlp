As competition for video subscribers heats up in the New York City area, Verizon Communications Inc. has taken a swipe at cable TV rival Cablevision Systems Corp., accusing it of infringing on several Verizon digital set-top box patents.
</P>
<P>
Verizon filed a complaint Tuesday with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of certain digital set-top boxes used by Cablevision. Verizon accuses the cable operator of violating five of its patents, including one on programmable set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
Verizon also wants Cablevision to stop offering for sale or lease imported digital set-top boxes that allegedly violate its patents.
</P>
<P>
It says Cablevision is using Verizon set-top box technology to compete against it. Verizon offers FiOs TV service in the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
Cablevision said Verizon is suing because it can't compete.
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming increasingly clear that Verizon is having difficulty competing on the merits in the marketplace, so they are resorting to filing lawsuits and pursuing regulatory bailouts," Cablevision said in a statement. "We obviously plan a vigorous defense."
</P>
<P>
Verizon said it limited its complaint to one claim for each patent so that the matter could be resolved quickly in about 12 months.
