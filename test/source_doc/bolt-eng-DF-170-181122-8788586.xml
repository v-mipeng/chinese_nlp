My standard response to Rdean's threads is a face palm.

I think this is going to be my response to Dante from now on. Pointless and silly, just like Dante

Pity that in this version the one playing Yuki is a dude.

Current event?

Dainty whining is a current event?

It might be a several times a day event but that hardly makes it 'current'. To the Romper Room with you Dainty.

Thank you Dante, for demonstrating dishonor.

An example is worth a thousand words.

Does that mean that when liberals tell me it was dishonorable for this country to condone slavery they are wrong? How about us invading Iraq, Vietnam, or Afghanistan? Were all of those honorable actions? Was using nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki honorable?

ome people just like to argue. this whole business with restoring america is ridiculous. we're a divided nation of ideals, but we are also a nation that grows politicians that go around preaching that we need to be saved. president obama will go on tv tomorrow night and say eleven times, how he is keeping his campaign promises about "ending the war". he will take credit for slaying the monster saddam, and democracy in iraq.
even though we still have fifty or so thousand combat troops (because all soldiers are combat troops first). his whole campaign was based on saving and restoring america.
we're mostly fine folks, notwithstanding some basic needs for people who want to work but can't find it. the country wasn't about to collapse, as obama says, he didn't save us, cause we didn't need saving, it's all hyperbole. i can't remember president bus going around blaming everyone else for the bad stuff, and constantly rallying to tell people that "he has saved us for economic death, or any other kind of impending doom.
he kind of rminds me of this generation that gets trophys for everything, he is the most insecure president i've seen, why else would he constantly, and publicly pat himself on the back? history will tell us how great he was, he doesn't need to tell us everyday. even the katrina speech yesterday, he just sounded so fake, raking bush over the coals, while promoting himself with flowery bullshit cliches about how great he will make new orleans. deep down he's a scared little boy, and a lucky one at that.
finally, i still think about how tremendous president bush was after 911, i wish anyone could unite the country in that way again, without a tragedy like that day. i'm afraid that era has ended, the prize in the "power of the whitehouse and congress" has transcended what's best for the country. as for dante, he can say whatever he wants, his opinion is just as vital as anyone elses in this forum, with out dissent at the grass roots level (like this sausageboard), we would never make the civil and peaceful transitions of power that we do, we would be just like venezuala or iran. when he's through with his victory laps tomorrow night, someone should hand him a great big shiny trophy with his name on it.

Remember how a lot of people went on and on about Michelle Obama when she said she was finally proud of being an American....as if she never were proud beforehand?

Were all those people in Washington D.C. on Saturday without honor before then? And were the Honor Lost &amp; Found booths big enough for them to reclaim their honor? Was there enough for them all?

Bodecea...I think that they were trying to reclaim America from the socialist and the communists, like Michelle Obama and her husband.

Beck's rally was an important step in preventing our flag from having the stars replaced by a hammer and sickle.

You didn't know that?
