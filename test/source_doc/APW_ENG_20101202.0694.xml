Iowa prisons could soon be stocking prison-made toilet paper to save taxpayers money and provide jobs to inmates.
</P>
<P>
The Des Moines Register newspaper reported on Thursday that inmates at two Iowa prisons are testing a single-ply tissue processed at a Missouri prison.

<P>
Roger Baysden, director of Iowa Prison Industries, says Iowa inmates could start processing their own toilet paper next year -- if the Legislature supports the idea.
</P>
<P>
Iowa prisons use about 900,000 rolls of toilet paper annually. Processing it in-house would save about $100,000 a year and would create jobs for about 50 inmates.

<P>
Al Reiter, the associate warden at the prison in Anamosa, Iowa, says the paper is not fluffy but the state says it's an acceptable roll.
