This is an Alex Jones interview so be warned, but the interviewee is Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, in Washington, D.C.

Mark Weisbrot, will be joining Alex on the show today to discuss recent moves by a group of emerging-market powers called BRICS that aims to destroy the dollar and bring about a new world currency.

More info on BRICS:

<quote>
In economics, BRIC is a grouping acronym that refers to the countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, which are all deemed to be at a similar stage of newly advanced economic development. It is typically rendered as "the BRICs" or "the BRIC countries" or alternatively as the "Big Four".

Thoughts? Opinions? I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to SDR's and this world currency talk. I remember a while back the "president" of Russia showed off a sample coin from this website called "Future World Currency":
<a href="http://www.futureworldcurrency.com/">http://www.futureworldcurrency.com/</a>

at the 2009 G20 stating that should be the new world currency, but have not heard any developments since.

This is old news, and isn't a conspiracy. It also doesn't provide one ounce of support for this "new world currency" crap. BRICs is simply doing what all nations do during recessions - waging their fingers and "threatening" to stop using the dollar. Countries made the same threads in the early 2000s, the early 1990s, and every other economic recession we've been through. Never happens, and cannot happen for the foreseeable future, because there is no feasible alternative.

Next.

If they were feasible, they'd stop the talking and do it.

They don't stop talking, because they know Euros are linked to countries that are in much worse shape long-term than the US is.

Is it all talk? How about a petro ruble?
<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/265375-russia-doesn-t-want-any-more-dollars-what-this-means-for-investors">Russia Doesn't Want Any More Dollars - What This Means for Investors</a>

As a result of its status as the world’s biggest energy exporter, the Russian state has accumulated about $300 billion worth of U.S. dollar denominated foreign exchange reserves. It doesn’t want any more. After decades of eagerly accepting dollar payments, Russia has quietly asked its trading partners to pay in rubles.

Vladimir Putin's original announcement, back on May 10, 2006, that Russia intended to increase the value of the ruble and make it into a reserve currency, caused a shock to currency markets, sending the dollar temporarily downward. But, shortly thereafter, few people paid much attention. The World Financial Crisis intervened, oil prices crashed, and the Russian ruble plunged against the dollar. Quietly, behind the scenes, however, Putin continued to work on making his dream a reality.

Russia has been slowly converting oil and gas customers to paying in rubles rather than dollars. China and Belarus have already agreed. With special pricing incentives, others, like Ukraine, will follow. Occasionally, the once and future Russian President continues to have very nasty things to say about the U.S. dollar. He can't seem to hold back his annoyance toward American economic policies. But, where he is scripted, as in speeches to the Russian Duma, he now creates a facade that implies the world wants to turn to rubles, rather than dump dollars.

The base currency market is smaller than most people realize. It consists of the amount of currency in demand deposits and cash, held by individuals, banks and, mostly, government foreign exchange reserves. When nations shift the right to receive money from recipient to recipient, but $94 billion must be changed from one currency to another, that money must leave central bank currency reserves somewhere in the world, year after year. Ultimately, it means $94 billion per year less demand for U.S. Treasuries. That is a huge reduction because the U.S. government is trying to sell about $1.6 trillion worth of new debt every year. The loss would need to be absorbed somewhere in the system, and that means a reduction in the exchange value of the dollar.

If other commodity exporters follow Russia's example, the dollar could deeply decline in real purchasing power. It will be in good company, however. The world financial markets are also now floating on a sea of pound, yen, Euro, and yuan liquidity. Commodity exporters like Putin are not easily fooled by Federal Reserve perceptions managers. They often know about hyperinflation. Russia experienced it first-hand after the fall of the former Soviet Union. The monetary authorities of that doomed state and its successors began by wildly printing money and ended by wiping out the middle class. Brazil and others also know how devastating heavy inflation can be.

Russia may be among the first major trading nations to exit the dollar reserve currency zone. Thankfully, Russia is trying to exit in a controlled manner to avoid disrupting markets. Russia still holds a huge number of dollars in its reserve fund, and it will take time to get rid of them. While we do not believe that the Federal Reserve Note dollar will end the decade at zero, or as toilet paper, we do expect it to command a very small fraction of its current buying power.

I'm not particularly concerned as it would actually not be in the interest for the BRIC countries to destroy the US Dollar. Talking about it sounds good to populists in their countries but the economic reality is that doing so would be a nightmare for them.

Seems to me there IS a one-world currency already.

It's called the "US dollar".

So what they are talking about is an alternate one-world currency, not based on the greenback. Hey ho.

Weisbrot appears to be something of a kook himself, which is not surprising as most "economists" appearing with Alex (e.g., Max Keiser, Gerald Celente) are pretty much bonkers. What is a little surprising is that Weisbrot appears to be on the left of the political spectrum, with publication credits including The Nation and the Huffington Post.

Why does Wikipedia have one article on BRIC (linked to in the OP) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS">one very similar</a> on BRICS? The S now officially stands for South Africa, which joined at the summit earlier this month. The BRIC article omits this. I call conspiracy. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

<a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/apr2011/bric-a18.shtml">BRICS summit denounces “use of force” against Libya</a>

<quote>
The third summit of the BRICS grouping—Brazil, Russia, India and China, plus South Africa this year—in Sanya on the Chinese island of Hainan on April 14, produced further signs of deepening tensions between the world’s major powers. [...]

Despite these and other disputes, the BRICS countries have come together to defend their mutual interests in the face of increasingly aggressive military interventions by the US and European powers, which continue to dominate the global economic institutions. Far from making room for the “emerging powers,” the established capitalist powers are intent on using their military and economic might to reassert their dominance.
