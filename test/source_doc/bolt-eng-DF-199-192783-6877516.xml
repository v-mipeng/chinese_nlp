Mr Still, you misspelled the name...

Sonya Cruz IS a writer for the Associated Press.

Akashat, Iraq WAS the place where Iraq's 'special weapons' projects were based.

Just a newbie trying to make a bit of a stir first post out.

As they used to say, the recipie for the best tall tales is 2 parts truth to one part lie. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

A wunderkind on A2K? I smell more BS.
</post>
<post author="Fedral" datetime="2004-05-21T09:17:00" id="p15">
I could see it last night... all the Lefties on this board looking at that topic title.

They reached out with trembling hands and moved the mouse to the title and closed their eyes as they double clicked.

They waited for the topic to load, they wished that they had a God to pray to, to make it not true.

As they read the first few lines, they wondered how they were going to face life with the WMDs actually being in existence.

They read on, feeling a cold chill in their guts as if they had been knifed. Saying to themselves:
"The Republicans CAN'T have been right... everyone knows only WE know what is best."

Wondering how they would face the Rights on A2K ever again if it were true, many contemplating joining monasteries.

Many of them looking at their President Bush dartboards and wondering if they were wrong about him....

And then, it is revealed as a hoax and the bubble of fear goes pop.

The Leftist coloured goggles slip back in place over their eyes and once again, their world is in its proper place.

Double checking before they nervously laugh and hit the back button, they look over to their dartboard and through the goggles, President Bush once again looks like Satan....

All is once again well in their world.

I don't know Fedral. We a re a rather well read and well informed group here at A2K. I am pretty sure that most had an idea the headline was false.

It's probable that one or two may have had a sinking feeling in the pits of their stomach, but I doubt it had the impact that you state above.

It's funny thinking about it like you say though. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

Well I sure didn't take for granted that it was false. I clicked on the link and searched all my routine news sources before debunking the piece.

G.T. made me look. So I concur. Well done. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

Well, present company no doubt excepted, I just think there are some who are so eager to discredit the president, they would believe anything bad said about him and would probably not check to see if it was true.

I joined several forums just to post it. There are two people in two forums that actually initially believed it, many thought it was fake <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"/>. I thought it looked genuine, but I haven't considered people googling. Blasted, my plan is foiled again. Well, you guys may not hear from me again, "Team Rocket blasting away, weee." Bye, bye.
